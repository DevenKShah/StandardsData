The dispensation will last from 19/04/24 to 30/09/25, but may be withdrawn if the dispensation is no longer necessary.End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required. The key changes are: Apprentices cannot opt-out of undertaking the APM Project Management Qualification (PMQ) exam as it is still mandated within version 1.3 of this standard. However, apprentices who are ready for Gateway that have attempted, but not yet passed the PMQ exam are permitted to enter Gateway and proceed to EPA. These apprentices can sit their EPA and pass their apprenticeship without having attained the PMQ.Training Providers must provide written evidence at Gateway that apprentices have been booked in for their PMQ exam/resit before they move forward with the EPA. EPAOs cannot withhold the apprenticeship certificate for apprentices who have sat their EPA, undertaken their PMQ exam and not yet passed or not received their PMQ result.If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is only intended to support the cohort of apprentices described above. FAQs1. If a learner attempts the PMQ exam and does not achieve the PMQ, are they required to retake the examination until they achieve a passing grade? Answer: Whilst they may not be required to retake the examination, we would suggest that it would be good for them to do this as they have already completed the work on the PMQ.2. What is the recommended timeline for learners to undertake or attempt the PMQ following the EPA? Answer: That is up to the individual and their employer on when they are ready to do this.Please contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity.",
