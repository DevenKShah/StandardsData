  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the healthcare service delivery environment, although some Clinical Scientists also work in academic research, public health and teaching, or in the medical equipment industry. Clinical Scientists are registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and have a specific scientific knowledge in a healthcare environment. This apprenticeship standard is available to individuals in professions which would be eligible for HCPC registration as a Clinical Scientist, which is a protected title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to collect, analyse and provide expert interpretation of clinical and specialist scientific data and make key judgements and decisions about complex facts and clinical situations. Clinical Scientists communicate scientific and clinical information to ensure that the benefits to patients are maximised and the risks minimised. Where appropriate, Clinical Scientists instruct others to take action, taking into account the wider clinical resource implications of the decision. Clinical Scientists apply their knowledge to improve patient care in all clinical contexts, through the safe application of complex science, engineering or technology. Clinical Scientists lead innovation, research and development directed towards improving human health, and participate in education and training. For example, conducting research in new diagnostic and/or treatment techniques, developing new devices or processes, implementing and translating scientific research and advances into routine clinical practice and raising awareness of their role with the general public. They have a key role in assuring the quality of clinical scientific services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinical Scientists work across the whole patient pathway and breadth of healthcare environments in a range of scientific areas, including but not limited to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Bioinformatics – collecting and analysing complex data systems &lt;br /&gt;• Life sciences – examining, investigating, diagnosing and treatment of disease, including decontamination science, pathology, genetics and reproductive science&lt;br /&gt;• Physical sciences and engineering – applying physical sciences and engineering to a large range of clinical services&lt;br /&gt;• Physiological sciences – evaluating the performance and functionality of the body’s organs using technologies and specialist equipment to diagnose abnormalities, and to direct, and in some cases, provide therapeutic intervention and long-term management and care. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further information about the areas above, is available from NHS Careers and the National School of Healthcare Science at https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/healthcare-science/roles-healthcare-science .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of healthcare professionals in the healthcare sector including medical and nursing staff, allied health professionals and pharmacists, as well as patients, carers and relatives. They may also interact with other organisations such as professional and government bodies (Health and Safety Executive, Care Quality Commission and the Environment Agency), equipment manufacturers and their engineers, pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies and university academics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for making clinical decisions, if appropriate, and providing scientific advice to patients, clinicians and other healthcare professionals that affect patients in many clinical contexts. Some Clinical Scientists deliver interventions in patient treatment and may be responsible for patient management. They would normally act independently within the bounds of their knowledge and scope of practice and would report to a more senior clinical scientist, such as a Consultant Clinical Scientist, who might be their head of department. Some Clinical Scientists may also advise trusts and national bodies on policy issues. They may supervise other staff assigned to support the services being provided.&lt;/p&gt;",
