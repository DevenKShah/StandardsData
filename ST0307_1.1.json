Cargo can include any goods imported to, or exported from the UK, such as cars, food, manufactured goods and raw materials and the work they do depends on the type of ship or cargo. Operatives in larger ports tend to specialise, but smaller ports often require them to perform a wide range of duties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Port operatives may be involved in:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loading, unloading, handling and securing cargo (including general, bulk, project, liquid and freight containers).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Warehousing, storage and retrieval e.g. checking, marking and despatching cargo.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roll-on/roll-off (RoRo) vessel operations, e.g. moving all kinds of wheeled vehicles via ramps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On-shore mooring and vessel handling operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passenger operations e.g. directing passengers and handling baggage.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Workplace transport operations, e.g. directing and moving driving vehicles/cargo&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure operations e.g. operating lock gate and bridges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate heavy machinery, operate specialised port operating equipment (such as ship-to-shore container and general cargo cranes, conveyor belts/suction pipes for grain and pipelines for oil tankers) and lifting and handling equipment (such as mobile cranes, lift trucks, materials handlers, straddle carriers, reach stackers etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Port Operative may be required to work on board any type and size of moored or anchored vessel in a port.&amp;nbsp; Port Operatives typically work in teams under the direction of a supervisor and are an essential part of the core function of a port and maintaining a safe environment. Working hours may include unsocial hours and working outdoors in inclement weather is probable. There may be some on-call requirement and shift and weekend work is likely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Port Operative’s occupation is most commonly broken down into cargo and passenger roles:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo Operatives&lt;/strong&gt; safely and efficiently load and discharge vessels in a wide range of locations. They handle cargo commodities which can include break bulk, dry bulk, liquid bulk, RoRo and containers. They enable the onward movement of all cargo types in support of warehousing and storage operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passenger, Ferry and Cruise Operatives&lt;/strong&gt; safely and efficiently load and unload passengers, their baggage and vehicles from vessels. They monitor travel documentation and assist security procedures such as search and screening. They have a direct role in responding to emergencies and in assisting passengers and third parties in the event of an emergency.&amp;nbsp; They interact directly with members of the public as well as trade customers and are required to demonstrate a high degree of customer care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will determine their own entry requirements but due to the nature of the role it is expected that candidates will meet certain medical standards of physical health.&amp;nbsp; Possession of a driving licence is likely to be advantageous.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 1 English and Maths must achieve this and take the test for level 2 prior to taking their end-point assessment. However, for those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and Maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship adopts a core and options approach to allow flexibility for employers and enable transferability between roles and employers for apprentices. All apprentices must attain competence in each of the core knowledge, skills and behaviours. In addition, one specialist option (for additional knowledge and skills) must be taken out of either cargo operative or passenger/ferry/cruise operative:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-right: 0cm; text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;CORE BEHAVIOURS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All Port Operatives need to demonstrate the following behaviours:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Act professionally;&lt;/strong&gt; demonstrating integrity, credibility, honesty, dependability, determination, adaptability and personal drive.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation can be found in a variety of ports, harbours, and marinas. From a major international trade gateway, Naval base supporting the Royal Navy, to a single jetty jutting out into a river or sea. A port is typically a location on the coast where goods are loaded and unloaded, however they can be found inland such as the Manchester ship canal and Port of Boston in Lincolnshire. Ports serve many purposes, including recreation, commercial trade, the energy sector and defence. The port industry is diverse, supporting a wide range of activities vital to many sectors of the UK economy. Ports are critical transportation networks that facilitate both international and domestic trade.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The UK has the largest port sector in Europe, with 120 commercial ports. Port operatives may be employed by large port authorities, such as the Port of Felixstowe. Which handles roughly 48% of all containerised trade within the UK, to other porting authorities such as the Port of Boston or enlisting as a port operative in the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Port operatives have key roles in enabling businesses to deliver on time and safely. Cargo can include any goods imported or exported from the UK, such as cars, food, manufactured goods, and raw materials. The work they do varies depending on the type of ship or cargo. Operatives in larger ports tend to specialise, but smaller ports often require them to perform a wide range of duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Port operatives are engaged to ensure that freight is moved efficiently from a docked ship, directly to a road vehicle or train for onward transportation, or to a warehouse or holding area for temporary storage. Port operatives may be required to operate large items of mobile and fixed lifting equipment and other vehicles, such as forklift trucks and mobile cranes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A port operative may be required to work on board any type or size of moored or anchored vessel in a port.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Port operatives can also work in passenger operations, ensuring that customers of ferry services or cruise liners travel through the port safely and efficiently. While maintaining excellent customer service. Passenger facilities at ports can be similar to those found at airports, with catering and other recreational services for passengers waiting to join the ship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working hours may include unsocial hours, and working outdoors in inclement weather is probable. There may be some on-call requirements as well as shift and weekend work. The working environment is likely to be physically demanding. Entry restrictions may apply to applicants.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
