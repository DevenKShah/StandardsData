  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;. build, maintain and move grip equipment during productions&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the film and TV sectors and work can be carried out either on set or on location. Depending on the production requirements, conditions on location can be demanding and include extreme terrain, climates or weather conditions. Employers can be large or small equipment rental houses - that rent out equipment to the film and TV industry, film or TV production companies or film or TV studios. However, the vast majority of the sector is freelance â€“ employed for the duration of specific productions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to build, maintain and move grip equipment during productions, so that the position and movement required by cameras are achievable. This can include equipment such as track, dollies, cranes and jib arms. This is a specialised role which involves constructing and operating bespoke machinery. A grip will select and obtain suitable equipment, materials and consumables. They will also lay track and install rigging mounts, dollies, platforms, cranes, jib arms and remote-controlled heads before filming commences. During filming this involves tracking cameras, dollies, cranes and jib arms so that desired shots are obtained. After filming it involves dismantling, cleaning and returning equipment. All work is carried out as part of a team. As grips need to set things up before filming can commence, it can involve working long and irregular hours. It involves working at height and working outdoors. It may also involve working away from home for periods of time. Driving is typically required as part of this role but is not an entry requirement for the apprenticeship.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other grips and other members of the camera department. They report to the key grip, who is in charge of their work. In addition, they need to interact with members of stunt, lighting and art departments on productions, as well as cast members, equipment hire ordering companies and delivery staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the health and safety of every aspect of their work. This is particularly important given the high-risk nature of the role as grip equipment and its operation has the potential to be very dangerous. A high level of professionalism is expected, and they are responsible for the quality of their work and completing their work to production timescales. Problem-solving is a key part of the role as is engineering knowledge as they may be required to lay track in complex and extreme situations. Communication and team-working is essential to the role. Grips will typically report to the key grip for each job. They work in teams and may refer to team members who have more experience than them or give support to those with less experience. Teams are supervised by the key grip. They will be responsible for the grip or crane equipment and the tools they use for assembly and dismantling it. They will be responsible for keeping the kit in good order, cleaning it and returning it in good condition to the equipment hire company. They are also responsible for reporting any loss or damage when it is finished with. There are no statutory or regulatory entry requirements for these occupations, but insurance typically dictates that entrants are likely to be at least 18.&lt;/p&gt;",
