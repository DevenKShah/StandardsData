  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;This occupation is found in the NHS, adult, children and young people’s social care services, independent practices, private health and care facilities, charitable organisations, and educational institutions. Family and systemic psychotherapists may work with a specific population, for example, children and young people, adults of all ages, or people with learning disabilities. They may provide family and systemic psychotherapy in a particular work setting, such as mental health or social care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help individuals, families, couples and wider networks to find ways to help each other when one or more members are struggling with mental health, relational and or behavioural difficulties. Family and systemic psychotherapists may provide therapy for whole families, parts of families, individuals, couples, or other significant relationships. They will typically explore the beliefs, behaviours, and relationships within the family to facilitate and engage members to share understanding and views with each other. This can enable the various individuals to better understand the issues they are experiencing that are causing concern and explore ways forward that work for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;Family and systemic psychotherapists draw on systemic approaches, theories and techniques with their clients and their networks to understand and address issues causing concern. This can help families to improve communication between members and with significant others outside of the family by making interactions more effective and productive. Improved communication can help individuals and families make important changes in the way they relate to each other and assist in resolving persistent patterns of conflict.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 107%;&quot;&gt;Typically, family members are seen together for therapy sessions, but family and systemic psychotherapists may work with individuals, couples, or combinations of family members.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This depends on who is available and what the presenting and emerging concerns are. Clients can be seen in mental health or social care consulting rooms and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;sometimes in their own homes. They can also be seen in formal family therapy clinics and in training contexts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;The clients that family and systemic psychotherapists engage may be experiencing high levels of distress.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This may manifest in a range of ways such as depression, anxiety, acts of self-harm, high expressed emotion or eating disorders. Family and systemic psychotherapists will undertake a detailed initial assessment discussion with their clients focusing on complex, sensitive and personal information related to their mental health difficulties.&amp;nbsp; This will also require the therapist to undertake and complete risk assessments, risk formulation and risk management for their clients.&amp;nbsp; From this they will then be required to draw upon this complex assessment material to provide verbal and written systemic formulations that will support evidence-based interventions for the individual, couple, or family they are working with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0; line-height: normal; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.5pt;&quot;&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the wider team in the organisation within which they are embedded, along with external professionals and networks.
