  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;x&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the built environment including in the new build, refurbishment and heritage sectors. Projects vary in size, type and duration, ranging from spraying and wallpapering for a domestic customer to the repair of a listed building to a large-scale commercial project using multiple, painting and decorating skills and application techniques and materials. Employers of craft painters and decorators vary in size from small companies to large commercial contractors. Craft painters and decorators are masters in their field and often provide technical leadership and supervise the work of others. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to work in the domestic, commercial and public sectors and is responsible for the external and internal appearance of a building and its protection from water, rust, corrosion, mould, and insect infestation. There is a direct relationship between the nature and quality of the service required and the payment made by the client. Therefore, the craft painter and decorator has a continuing responsibility to work professionally and interactively with the client in order to provide good quality services and satisfaction for clients and thus maintain and grow the business. Craft painting and decorating is closely associated with other parts of the construction industry, and with the many products that support it. The craft painter and decorator works internally and externally in very diverse environments, for example in companies, factories, schools, hotels, the homes of clients, and on building sites in all weather conditions. They may offer a range of services, from interpreting client requirements to the environmental and sustainability of materials/drawings, advising on designs/colours, painting, spraying, decorative coatings, wallpapering, gilding, and sign writing to a high standard. Work organisation and self-management, communication and interpersonal skills, problem solving, innovation, creativity, and the ability to prepare surfaces thoroughly with meticulous care including hazardous surfaces such as lead and asbestos are all required. These are the universal attributes of a craft painter and decorator. In a mobile labour market, the craft painter and decorator may work in teams or alone. Whatever the structure of the work, the trained craft painter and decorator takes on a high level of personal responsibility and autonomy. From carefully determining the requirements of the client, working safely and tidily, complying with relevant legislation, exceptional planning and scheduling, precision and attention to detail to every process matters, and mistakes are largely irreversible and costly. With the international mobility of people, the craft painter and decorator faces rapidly expanding opportunities and challenges. For a craft painter and decorator there are many commercial and international opportunities; however, these carry with them the need to understand and work with diverse cultures, trends, and fashions. The diversity of skills associated with craft painting and decorating is therefore likely to expand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their immediate team and the site management team on all painting and decorating aspects of the construction programme including planning, technical and progress. They often liaise with other construction trades such as site carpenters and plasterers who could work for their own organisation or another contractor. As the technical lead for craft painting and decorating they are also expected to liaise with other construction professionals for example the clerk of works and site manager and in the case of smaller specialist projects, the client, architect and interior designer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring the finishes they and their team create are of a high quality and meet standards, specifications and design plans. They are expected to do this with due regard to all safety aspects involved with working on a construction site, ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of themselves and others at all times. With sustainable construction at the forefront of all projects, it is expected they would give consideration and advise others on the environment and sustainability of materials, waste awareness and recycling. Level 3 has a relationship with level 2 and is a natural progression route for those who have completed Level 2 painting and decorating.&lt;/p&gt;",
