Qualifying as a Scaffolder provides opportunities to work in many different sectors including Construction, Infrastructure, Nuclear, Oil and Gas, Rail, and Events across the UK and internationally. The primary role of a Scaffolder is to provide access solutions or structural support which allows other trades to carry out their roles safely whilst working at height. Upon completion of this apprenticeship, the operative will have achieved the established trade competency for the scaffolding industry which will enable them to erect, alter and dismantle a wide range of scaffolding structures as covered by this training and assessment. Scaffolding is a safety critical trade and each individual working in the sector must be aware of their responsibility to themselves, those they are working with, the end user of the scaffold and also others who they may come into contact with whilst carrying other their role e.g. other trades, clients, members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;546&quot; style=&quot;width: 546px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;546&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion the Scaffolder will have the following core knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The relevant British and European Standards, NASC guidance e.g. TG20, SG4, SG6 and statutory regulations applicable to the correct and safe erection and dismantling of scaffolds and where to find additional information e.g. NASC website, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The types, uses and methods of inspection, and the purpose of various scaffold materials e.g. tubes, boards and fittings in common use.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The methods of handling, stacking, and servicing scaffold materials e.g. tubes, boards and fittings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The types, uses and purpose of prefabricated beams, and the rules for their assembly and connection to scaffold structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The purpose, types, uses and loadings of protection fans.
