  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment construction sector. The construction industry is central to creating the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure society needs.&#160; There is growing demand for carpenters and joiners to help meet the need for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is working with building materials (most often wood) to create and install building components.&#160; This typically involves shaping and cutting materials, installing finished materials like partitions, doors, staircases, window frames, mouldings, timber floor coverings and erecting structural components such as floor joists and roofs. All work needs to be carried out safely, using the appropriate tools and to the quality specified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation includes two different options and people will either work on a construction site as a Site Carpenter or in a workshop as an Architectural Joiner.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Site Carpenter will prepare and install basic building components e.g. doors, straight staircases, wall and floor units and erecting structural carpentry and roof structures on a building site or in domestic and commercial premises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Architectural Joiner will produce building components by setting out, marking out and manufacturing basic architectural products, including doors, windows, straight staircases and associated ironmongery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other construction trades such as bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers, supervisors, site management, architects, designers, contractors and customers. A Site Carpenter would generally liaise with other trades such as bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers, supervisors, site management and contractors. Architectural joiners would liaise with other workshop colleagues and supervisors as well as architects, designers and customers. An employee in either option of this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, under supervision, using machinery and/or tools to create structures or components from designs, plans and specifications that meet the clientâ€™s expectations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, under supervision, using machinery and tools to create structures or components from the designs, plans and specifications of architects and designers that meet the clients expectations. On site these could include roof structures, floors, partitions and second fix work such as door frames and skirting. As an architectural joiner, they could include doors, windows and stairs, including all ironmongery.&lt;/p&gt;",
