  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the print and graphics communication sector. It may be found in printing, packaging, creative and design industries. This can include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;magazines, newspapers, books and posters&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;cartons, packaging, signs and banners&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;personal gifting, such as calendars, photo books and greeting cards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;functional printing onto materials other than paper, such as plastics, electronic circuits (to make flexible screens), textiles and a wide range of other materials&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;physical printed security products such as passports, ID cards, banknotes and credit cards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship standard. Apprentices are trained and assessed against the core and one option:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 1: Pre-press operative&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 2: Press operative&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 3: Post-press operative. &#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers vary in size from small to large. Print operatives may work in copy shops, reprographic units, specialist print businesses or large multinational organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to assist in the production of a printed product or component. Print operatives read and understand work instructions, use relevant print equipment, carry out checks before and during the process. They update all paperwork and check that the final output meets the specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Print production is a three-stage process: pre-press, press and post-press.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-press operatives receive customer files and prepare them for printing.&#160; They use a maximum of two software packages. They check customer files for errors. They produce customer proofs, plates, cylinders, screens and electronic files.&#160; They also calibrate print equipment as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Press operatives set up the printing press. They check materials against work instructions. They inspect output at set intervals and report any issues. They clean the print machinery, prepare work for the next department and perform basic maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Post-press operatives set up finishing equipment. They check materials against work instructions. They inspect output at set intervals and report any issues. They load materials into the finishing machine, prepare work for the next department and perform basic maintenance.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their team. &#160;They also work with other departments, such as customer services or the sales team, within the business. Depending on the size or structure of the business, they may also be required to interact with external customers. Pre-press operatives are typically office based. Press operatives and post-press operatives are typically located in a production environment such as a factory.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for setting up and loading equipment ready for use, checking materials or files supplied. They also ensure that all work meets quality assurance requirements and the customer brief. All work must be completed in line with health, safety and environmental regulations and considerations. Where applicable, they may have to wear personal protective equipment and follow workplace safety rules such as safely handling hazardous materials.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
