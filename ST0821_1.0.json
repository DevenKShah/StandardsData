  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A thatched roof is sustainable, environmentally-friendly, with a low carbon footprint, and of high insulation value. There are over 100,000 thatched properties in the UK and a large proportion of these are listed, meaning that the roofs must be replaced on a like-for-like basis. Thatchers conserve our heritage, benefitting tourism and the wider economy. New properties throughout some counties in the UK are also being built with thatched roofs, due to planning restrictions requiring a proportion of all new builds needing to be thatched. Thatching work covers commercial, agricultural, domestic, new-build and historic buildings with a variety of differing roof designs and materials. The thatcher needs to have an understanding of the complexities and variants in regional style, materials, vermin control and fire safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with clients, suppliers and master thatchers. During the course of a typical job, thatchers may interact with architects, conservation officers, clients and members of the public. Thatchers spend the majority of their time working at height, outdoors and in varying weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be involved in jobs from beginning to end from sourcing materials to organising other trades to roof preparation through to final thatching works and clearing of site. Some thatchers may even grow their own straw and make their own spars and liggers. The thatcher will also be responsible for understanding and implementing the appropriate site health, safety and welfare conditions.&lt;/p&gt;",
