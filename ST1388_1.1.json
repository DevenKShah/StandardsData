A large proportion of photographers are freelance or self-employed, operating their own studio or supplying multiple clients. They are to be found across England and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The output and remit of a Photographic studio is varied, and they will produce work for a range of clients across subject areas. Some studios may specialise in one subject area, e.g. wedding or portrait photography.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to work autonomously and with customers or clients collaborating with other departments as required to produce, manage and deliver photographic assets to meet agreed requirements.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with clients, subjects, retouchers and other stakeholders involved in the production of images. They will set up and operate photographic equipment in a manner to obtain the best image in accordance with the customer/client brief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will need to be aware of the activities of their occupation which contribute to their “professional carbon footprint” and steps to reduce this.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a junior level role, and the line management and reporting structure of the team will vary according to the size of the employer, this could involve working to a supervisory photographer. Learners must be able to take direction and feedback, to create the photographic images required, according to the brief.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They can work in indoor studios as well as outside locations using digital or film cameras; producing stills or video imagery of a variety of subjects and objects for a wide range of uses. Photographers tend to work in digital formats with DSLR or mirrorless cameras. A very small number of specialist photographers may use analogue equipment with silver-based imaging but this is not mainstream. Photographers offering video imaging services to customers/clients is increasing. Use of associated technology such as drones is also becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for, carrying out skilled work in the photographic industry to generate, print or publish a photographic image. Some staff working in specialist areas will be responsible for processing and printing imagery from photographic films using non-digital equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship, the individual may move into further and higher education, or secure employment or self-employment in the respective sector of the photographic industry they have worked in.&lt;/p&gt;",
