Occupation(s)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Highway Electrical Maintenance and Installation Operative &lt;/strong&gt;is a multi-skilled operative able to carry out both the installation of equipment (e.g. street lighting columns, traffic signal poles) and the maintenance of that equipment (e.g. correcting faul ts when equipment is non-operational, changing lamps upon or close to failure).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are many sub-sectors within the highways electrics sector – e.g. street lighting, traffic signals, safety cameras, and highway communications.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Each uses different equipment and processes, and the apprentice will choose one of these depending on the specialism of their employer. The general duties, skills, competencies and behaviours are common across the sub-sectors but the detail and application is sub-sector specific depending on the sub-sectors chosen (e.g. the installation of traffic signal poles is different to the installation of lighting columns, but the principles of safe excavation and safe wor king are common)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main duties and tasks of someone who is a competent Highway Electrical Maintenance and Installation Operative within the relevant sub-sector(s) are to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install &amp;amp; maintain highway electrical support structures, equipment and systems (e.g. excavating and installing streetlight posts in the ground, installing traffic signal or safety camera poles, fitting Streetlighting lanterns or traffic signal heads, carrying out first line fault finding when items are reported as not working, carrying out routine replacement of lamps )&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out first line (i.e. first on site) emergency attendance and emergency works (e.g. after a road traffic incident where a vehicle hits a streetlight ensuring the site is safe for traffic and pedestrians)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out work efficiently, effectively and safely to keep costs within budget, ensure works are completed in accordance with drawings, specification of works and instructions given by an experienced worker or manager and within the specified time duration to avoid delays and accidents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain effective working relationships with colleagues, managers and members of the public whilst carrying out the works&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on their own initiative and in small teams (which consist typically of 2 people) Optionally: Apply surface protection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.
