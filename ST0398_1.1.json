  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation of Animal Training Instructor ATI is found in animal rescue, rehoming and rehabilitation centres, animal and disability charities, public service providers, security and Defence, search and rescue agencies, zoos and safari parks, commercial animal training companies and sole-providers of animal training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation varies dependent on species.&#160;The occupation enables animals to be used in different ways. This could include supporting companionship, assistance, competition, entertainment and security. In some cases, animal training is a critical addition to delivering health and welfare by enabling the animal co-operative care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to plan, manage and deliver the humane training of animals, with particular emphasis on tailoring training to suit a diverse range of guardians and environments. The term guardian&#39; covers owners, keepers, handlers and related stakeholders..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ATIs plan, teach and manage animal training that incorporates positive, reward based training methods.&#160; They work with guardians to help them introduce and reinforce desirable behaviours and avoid or modify undesirable behaviours. This may involve training the animal to undertake specific tasks, or more general training. They develop and adapt training plans to deliver appropriate goals at an appropriate rate. They will often train, mentor or supervise less experienced staff, colleagues or guardians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;Working patterns could involve irregular hours and operating in all weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;ATIs are required to show empathy, respect, patience, and tolerance in all situations to people and animals.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an ATI interacts with a diverse group of guardians and their animals. Guardians could have specific physical, emotional or medical needs and be working in complex, constrained, high-profile or dangerous environments and situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ATI may be required to work with other professionals such as, behaviourists, veterinary surgeons, healthcare providers, para-professionals and colleagues to assess the animal, develop, deliver and adapt the training plan.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ATI will be responsible for the safety and welfare of animals, guardians, other colleagues and animals and themselves. They must ensure that all training is carried out appropriately and in a suitable environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ATI is responsible for ensuring the training plan is relevant, effective, fit for purpose and under continuous review.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An ATI must ensure that training complies with relevant animal welfare and veterinary legislation for example, the Animal Welfare Act 2006; Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966; Animal Welfare (Sentience) 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
