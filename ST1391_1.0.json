  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the maritime defence sector, as well as in the commercial shipping sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out fabrication, installation and repair work of pipework systems on maritime ships or submarines. Maritime pipeworkers must have a good understanding of safe systems of work, confined spaces and working at height. They work from engineering drawings, data and documentation in order to undertake the fabrication, installation, testing and removal of pipework systems on ships or submarines in defence or commercial shipping. This can include systems associated with propulsion, machinery, weapons, reactor and auxiliary (such as water, air conditioning and power generation). It requires knowledge and expertise in the use of&amp;nbsp; pipe forming machines and hand tools. The maritime pipeworker will use a variety of measuring and fault finding techniques to ensure individual components and assemblies meet the required specification within specified time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A maritime pipework system will supply fuel, fresh water, chilled water, air conditioning, lubricating oil, waste water and will comprise of flanges, valves, gaskets and pressure gauges. Pumps, motors, tanks and reservoirs are not considered to be part of the pipework system, however maritime pipeworkers will install and connect pipework to the source of energy such as a chilled water pumps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the ship or submarine delivery or production teams. Maritime pipeworkers typically work on board vessels at sea or in dock, or in maritime workshop environments. They may work in confined spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for complying with statutory regulations, organisational safety requirements and will be expected to work both individually and as part of the ship or submarine delivery team. They will work with minimum supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of their work which will be subject to quality checks to ensure it meets the required standard. They will undertake and be proactive in finding solutions to problems and identifying improvements to business processes.&lt;/p&gt;",
