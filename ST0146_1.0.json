  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role / Occupation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Assessor-Coach (AC)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 15 months to gateway&#160;i.e. excluding EPA period.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AC role has emerged within the Education and Training Sector (ETS), over the last 30 years, originally as a result of the implementation of vocational (competence-based) qualifications (notably NVQs) and formalised work-based education and training. The AC is a &lt;em&gt;dual professional&lt;/em&gt;, using their up-to-date professional knowledge and skills to support vocational and professional development across the formal ETS as well as in any employer setting, and at any level. They may, for example, coach and assess apprentices, trainees or new recruits (ranging from young entrants, to new CEOs) in the workplace, commensurate with their own level of experience and qualifications, as required by their employer or their sector. &#160;ACs coach and assess vocational learners, usually on a one-to-one basis, in a range of learning environments.&#160; Coaching skills involve complex communication techniques to actively listen, provide feedback and to engage learners in planning their individualised learning programme. These skills are also integral to assessing learners’ competence in-relation to work-related/industry standards and life skills.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACs work co-operatively with other ETS or professionals (such as teachers, human resource professionals and mentors/supervisors in the workplace) in supporting the learner’s development of vocational competence and the wider skills that relate to employability and professionalism.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;Within the sector, ‘coaching’ is seen as a more complex set of interpersonal skills, compared with ‘mentoring’.&#160; It is more learner-centred, exploring the learner’s understanding and needs rather than simply giving advice. (See the Level 3 Learning Mentor Standard for further clarification about these two different roles.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AC apprenticeship requires the development of following professional behaviours, knowledge and skills:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional behaviours. The Assessor-Coach will:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: lower-alpha;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inspire, motivate and raise learners’ aspirations through their passion for the sector&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate at all times to ethical and legal standards and within professional boundaries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model and encourage mutual respect, displaying a deep understanding of equality and diversity, with and between learners, colleagues and appropriate agencies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be resilient and adaptable when dealing with challenge and change, maintaining focus and self-control&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Value the importance of maths, English and ICT skills in the learners’ future economic and social well-being&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Evaluate and improve their own professional practice in relation to the Professional Standards for Teachers and Educators in the Education and Training Sector&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Assessor-Coach will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Assessor-Coach will understand:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan coaching and assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedures for planning coaching and assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;S1&#160;
