They ensure the safety and integrity of nuclear related fabrications to meet the exacting quality requirements specified in nuclear industry regulations, specifications, standards and detailed engineering documents. These are unique to the sector, hence the knowledge, skills and behaviours required to deploy this role are specific for the nuclear industry. They operate in a challenging environment where quality standards are paramount and safety is the overriding priority. This work will involve carrying out detailed observations, making detailed records, giving technical feedback and providing challenge throughout the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;They perform inspection work on nuclear licensed sites (waste management, decommissioning, construction and operational nuclear plants) or in manufacturing facilities which supply the nuclear industry. The working conditions are varied and may involve wearing specialist safety equipment, shift working and working on sites and facilities running 365 day operations. They are expected to work individually and as part of an inspection team. They need to be able to work with minimum supervision, in a professional manner, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements: Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge: &lt;/strong&gt;A NWIT will be able to understand and apply:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aterial Science – &lt;/strong&gt;They understand materials, specifically metallic, and their behaviour during welding. They have a thorough appreciation of metal types, properties, composition and failure mechanisms to support the selection process for nuclear applications. This will include weldability of material, consumable selection, joining dissimilar materials, heat treatment as well as the potential metallurgical issues. They will also understand the fundamental aspects of destructive testing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;elding Technology – &lt;/strong&gt;They will be fully aware of the Quality Assurance requirements for welded constructions and have a clear understanding of the welding processes including accepted terminology, standards and abbreviations, i.e. tools &amp;amp; equipment, process and parameters, weld procedure &amp;amp; welder approval process and subsequent documentation &amp;amp; records.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;elding Inspection – &lt;/strong&gt;They will fully understand all of the nuclear industry quality control requirements during welding and have the ability to undertake all three stages of weld inspection, i.e. before/during and after welding resulting in categorising of weld defect. This will also include the requirements for inspection reporting and verification of certification data in accordance with relevant standards.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NDT Techniques – &lt;/strong&gt;They will have a knowledge of Non Destructive Testing (NDT) techniques, specifically Liquid Penetrant (LPI), Magnetic Particle (MPI), Radiographic (RT) &amp;amp; Ultrasonic (UT) Testing which are utilised to detect surface breaking and internal flaws. Understand why and when these techniques are deployed as well as the advantages and limitations of their use.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;afety – &lt;/strong&gt;They will understand the importance of safe working practices at a nuclear facility as well as the relationship between nuclear safety and quality, i.e. structured inspection mitigates the risk of a latent nuclear safety event. Be fully aware of the fundamental principles and implications of radiation types, sources, hazards and appropriate control measures. Understand how Human Performance and Human Factors affect the nuclear safety culture.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kills: &lt;/strong&gt;A NWIT will have the skills to ensure welds are of the highest quality. They do this by carrying out tasks before, during and after welding.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before Welding: &lt;/strong&gt;They ensure material storage, condition and certification is correct and that the welding process is in accordance with an approved procedure. They also ensure that the welder is qualified, welding equipment is in a suitable condition and calibrated, consumables are correctly specified, stored and certified and weld joint fit up and weld faces are correct and free from damage and contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During Welding: &lt;/strong&gt;They carry out process and parameter monitoring and verification ensuring current, voltage, heat and travel speed are in accordance with the welding procedure. Inspection of the weld root and verification of inter run cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;f&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;er Welding: &lt;/strong&gt;They carry out weld appearance &amp;amp; identification checks (visual inspection), Non-destructive testing, dimensional surveys against engineering drawings. They ensure subsequent repairs are completed and recorded, post weld heat treatment is in accordance with defined parameters and record completion &amp;amp; verification and subsequent inspection reporting.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The core skills to be developed during the apprenticeship are:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;echnical Requirement – &lt;/strong&gt;They can interpret engineering drawings and procedures to ensure fabrication and dimensional requirements are achieved.
