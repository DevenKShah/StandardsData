Typical job titles:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Highways maintenance electrician, Highways maintenance engineer, Highways operatives and Street lighting electrician&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Entry requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the entry requirements for this apprenticeship but typically candidates will have completed the Level 2 Highway Electrical maintenance and installation (HEMI) operative apprenticeship successfully and their Level 2 Certificate in Highway Electrical Work will be in date. Where the Level 2 HEMI has not been completed and the apprentice is following the Level 3 apprenticeship upskilling route, there is a requirement for the provider to carry out a training gap analysis to ensure that the required level of underpinning knowledge has been acquired before the programme start. The Provider will be required to review, plan and execute the required level of knowledge training in line with the Highway Electrical Vocationally Recognised Qualification Specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Qualifications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 apprenticeship and will result at the end of the apprenticeship, in gaining a Level 3 Certificate and a Level 3 NVQ Diploma&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. English and maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the End-Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Review date &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard should be reviewed no more than two years after approval of the standard&lt;/p&gt;",
