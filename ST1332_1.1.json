  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Cable jointers work in the power industry for power network owners, operators, or contractors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work on the electricity distribution network that supplies electricity to homes and businesses. They work on low voltage (LV) and high-voltage networks up to 11,000 volts, including LV live working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Office of gas and electricity markets (Ofgem) regulates the industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cable jointers connect new supplies, divert and make alterations to existing supplies, and locate and repair faults. They receive safety documents and organise and supervise a working party (group of workers). They monitor working conditions and react to maintain safety. Completing work and safety records is also part of their role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work at sites across a company’s or client’s power network. They may have to drive vehicles requiring driving licenses. They work in all weather conditions. They may have to be on standby duty and work shifts outside normal working hours. The role requires a good level of physical ability and involves working at height and in confined spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cable jointers work with other jointers and support operatives, as part of small or large teams. They also have contact with other internal and external stakeholders. This may include the network management centre, customer call centre, project managers, commissioning engineers, safety teams, site managers, other trades, and subcontractors. They speak with domestic and commercial customers regarding work and sometimes the public to keep them updated on work progress. They typically report to an experienced operational engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cable jointers are responsible for helping to maintain the safe supply of electricity and the development of flexible networks that are vital to achieving environmentally sustainable networks. Work must comply with the electricity safety, quality, and continuity regulations (ESQCR). Safety is a top priority for the industry. They must comply with health, safety, environmental, and sustainability regulations and procedures. Failure to do so could have serious consequences for self, others, and the environment. They must complete tasks in line with the network&#39;s procedures and specifications, to the required timescales and unit costs. They must present a professional image of the company and themselves. They must be competent to hold an authorisation to fulfil their duties under their company’s safety rules. They may need to hold CSCS (construction skills certification scheme card) cards.&lt;/p&gt;",
