  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Healthcare Science Assistant (HCSA) support workforce contributes to safe patient care across all care pathways from conception to end of life in job roles within hospitals, general practice and other settings in the healthcare sector and across all areas of healthcare science (&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; HCSAs perform a range of low risk, routine technical and scientific procedures usually within one broad area of HCS, following specific protocols and in accordance with health, safety, governance and ethical requirements. HCSAs work using standard operating procedures, initially under direct supervision but increasingly with experience, under indirect supervision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Responsibilities and duties of the role&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All HCSAs work effectively within a multi-professional team (MPT) within the limits of their competence, but must seek help and support whenever this is required. HCSAs must be aware of the requirements of Good Scientific Practice (GSP), which articulates the standards for the HCS profession and upon which this apprenticeship standard is based(&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;).&#160;Using these professional standards, the HCSA must adhere to employers’ policies and protocols to ensure safe and consistent practice within the working environments of HCS. Although not exhaustive, activities undertaken by the HCSA may include: basic life support; preparation of the environment for HCS procedures; production of reliable data, keeping accurate records; stock control of equipment and consumables; inputting and retrieving patient/test specific technical data within required governance processes; performing designated HCS role-specific skills following specified protocols.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Professional Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of the HCSA Apprenticeship individuals will be eligible to apply to join the Academy for HCS (AHCS) accredited register.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AHCS will require the Level 2 Diploma in Healthcare Science as an underpinning qualification for the HCSA apprenticeship. Apprentices must achieve Level 1 English and mathematics and take the test for Level 2 prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Level 2&lt;span&gt;

HCSAs perform a range of low risk, routine technical and scientific procedures usually within one broad area of HCS, following specific protocols and in accordance with health, safety, governance and ethical requirements. HCSAs work using standard operating procedures, initially under direct supervision but increasingly with experience, under indirect supervision.&lt;/p&gt;",
