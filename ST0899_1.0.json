  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the manufacturing sector, in the production of fashion and textiles items using various fabrics and materials such as canvas, cotton, leather, silk, vinyl, wool, woven and non-woven. Production ranges from bespoke to mass-produced items and includes, handbags, shoes, clothing, tents, industrial textiles, and numerous home wear products. Employers vary in size from micro to large.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to cut specified material components by hand or by machine using templates or measurements and then prepare the components for assembly. In preparation for cutting, a material cutter will select the materials following instructions, check the materials for quality issues, and plan, measure and calculate material usage ensuring waste minimalisation. They are then ready to cut components to meet the required quality, quantity, and specifications. They have a role in ensuring effective handover to the next stage, including bundling and labeling and completing records and documentation such as production/cutting sheets or work dockets. Material cutters are also responsible for dealing with quality issues and providing re-cuts as requested by the production team. In order to keep the process running smoothly, they maintain specialist machines and equipment, for example changing blades and chains, sharpening shears and blades, cleaning and removing lint and maintaining automated tables/machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Material cutters work in a production environment, often in a dedicated cutting room. They must have an eye for detail and be able to distinguish between colours and patterns. The role can be physically demanding, involving lifting heavy rolls of fabric and standing for long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other cutters, depending on the size and structure of the company. They will work under the supervision of a manager or supervisor and may interact with personnel from other teams such as production, maintenance, and stock control. They may also come into contact with external suppliers or customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for cutting materials to meet production targets and quality standards, ensuring continuous supply of cut components for the next stage in the process. They also need to achieve and maintain consistent standards in relation to material waste and time management. They are central to the efficiency and effectiveness of production; as once the material has been cut, little can be done to rectify serious mistakes and any errors will lead to problems at the assembly stage; minimising waste and ‘re-cuts’ is key. All work must be completed in line with health, safety and environmental regulations and considerations. They must wear personal protective equipment for example a chain mail glove and safety goggles, and follow workplace safety rules in the cutting room at all times.&lt;/p&gt;",
