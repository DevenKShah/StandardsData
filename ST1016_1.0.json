  "entryRequirements": "&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship is open to ‘in-house’ security operatives (direct employees) who usually do not need a Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence to provide security services and for employees who work for sub-contractors, who are providing security services and do need an SIA licence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where an apprentice has an SIA licence, assessment of the apprentice’s current competence, through recognition of prior learning and experience, forms part of the initial assessment process, which ensures that the apprentice is on the right programme and includes eligibility checks. Entry requirements will be a matter for individual employers, typically an apprentice will go through security vetting requirements. The CViT Operative option and Mobile Patrol Security Operative option must possess a valid driving licence. Employers will assist the apprentice with entry requirements before on-boarding.&lt;/p&gt;",

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a range of public, private and not for profit sectors. These can include iconic or historic locations, commercial or residential buildings, transport and rail installations, healthcare and educational facilities, retail outlets, logistics and the transportation of high net-worth assets and currency. Employment can range from a small front-of-house security team to large-scale nation-wide organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to be an organisation’s first line of defence against activities that threaten the security of the UK and continuity of its organisations&#39; core businesses. Professional security operatives protect people, assets, property and premises via a layered security approach. This includes the need to enforce legal requirements, policies, procedures (including Standard Operating Procedures and Emergency Operating Procedures) and rules to provide a safe and secure environment. Professional security operatives monitor assigned areas to act as a deterrent, identify hostile reconnaissance, identify suspicious items, people, or vehicles and respond to alarms, incidents and emergencies. They will conduct regular and random searches and report and record information following organisational procedure. Through the performance of these duties, professional security operatives also play a key role in counter terrorism activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operational security operatives are responsible for ensuring the safety of others, including large groups or crowds. They identify potential security risks and act upon them to maintain safety. They are responsible for searching, scanning, screening, crowd management, conflict management, patrolling, access and egress, and emergency procedures on the ground.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cash and valuables in transit (CViT) operatives ensure the safe and secure transportation of cash and a wide variety of valuables, including jewellery, art and precious metals. They use specially adapted vehicles and equipment such as protective secured boxes, personal protective equipment such as CViT helmets, body armour, and communication systems to ensure the safety of the valuables they transport.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mobile security patrol operatives patrol, conduct property inspections, lock and unlock premises and respond to alarms. These duties are carried out across a large portfolio of clients and a wide range of locations within a geographical area using an adapted vehicle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security control room operatives oversee and co-ordinate the operational response at the location they monitor, using control room equipment or through CCTV (also known as VSS or Video Surveillance Systems). They gather intelligence, disperse relevant information, monitor lone working, manage incidents and provide an interface to other protective services including the emergency services.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the public and a broad range of other stakeholders including the organisational hierarchy, peers, clients, contractors, sub-contractors, blue light services, and enforcement agencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for identifying the risk of the security of people, places, property and assets to protect them from threats that intentionally or accidentally exploit vulnerabilities. They work at pace and undertake duties independently, reporting to a shift supervisor, team leader or security manager. They may work as part of a security team, and must undertake professional development to enhance their skills and understand the company security culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Professional security operatives are on the front line and will be ambassadors for the security profession and the business in which they work. Integrity and honesty are paramount for the industry and future career choices. They will adhere to the dress code and use personal protection equipment when required. They will be professional, courteous, calm and empathetic in all situations and treat information and details confidentially in-house and externally. They will be respectful of team members and end-users and provide a high standard of customer service.&lt;/p&gt;",
