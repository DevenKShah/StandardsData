Typically this work can include live relays of sporting, music or other cultural events but may also involve recordings of dramas or music captured on location away from a studio. OBs are commissioned to provide content for TV, web, live cinema and corporate events from venues such as sports stadia, theatres, concert halls - or locations with little or no direct facilities to help the production such a farms, factories, historic buildings or churches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An OB crew may be based in an OB truck - a television studio gallery on wheels equipped with the same facilities needed in a fixed site installation - or they may be required to assemble a production gallery within a venue.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of safe working practices, a multi-skilled approach to the job and an enquiring mind that is able to problem-solve are all essential attributes of the OB Engineer. Whilst this is a technical role, there is a high degree of creativity required to work closely with a production team to deliver content right for the target audience and in keeping with the constraints of the location.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of Apprenticeship:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 12 - 18 months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically, an entrant will have a degree within an engineering or technical media discipline or have a substantial level of experience in a related work area (normally 3 years or more).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally a driving license and the flexibility to work away from home are essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;upa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tion Standards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge &lt;/strong&gt;– It is essential that an OB Engineer has an enquiring mind and a breadth of knowledge to problem solve in challenging environments. This requires understanding;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sound – venue acoustics, broadcast audio formats, noise regulations, loudness standards, microphone and cable types, audio desk controls and signal processing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vision – video paths, colour-matching, vision mixer systems, vision processing, fibre optic systems and signals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Media Management – video and audio recording systems, integration of edit choices, timecode, codecs, wrappers, file formats, processing, graphics and audio packaging&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Location based practice – site management, reporting and communication. Personal Protective Equipment requirements. Location and event related constraints on the OB.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Power Management – electrical supply types, generator or venue power connection, load management, equipment power supplies, weather effects on power.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cameras – types of camera mountings, lenses and panning heads. Camera systems, formats and accessories. Awareness of camera use and shot composition.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lighting – different lighting luminaires, fixings and mounts, LED and projector screens. Lighting levels, lighting problems and their solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Radio Frequency (RF) Systems – video and audio signals, levels &amp;amp; compression. Radio waves, antennas and the dB scale. Digital transmission systems. Delays from digital encoding. Frequency Management and regulation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Networking Technologies - Addressing protocols, compression algorithms for video / audio transport, external network storage systems and bandwidth bottlenecks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt; – A good technical ability, IT competency and aptitude to understand what produces good pictures and sound are core elements of the job role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Core skills of the OB Engineer:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sound – Set up microphones, find technical faults, use talkback kits, edit sound.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vision – Rig monitors, set up video equipment, soldering and find technical faults.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Media Management – set up and test recording systems with associated cabling requirements. Make and repair cable connectors.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Location based practice – Rig cables, work at heights, work on a stage and the safety constraints of working with a crowd. Regulations and risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Power Management – Distribution and management of power supplies on location.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cameras – cable bashing, camera set-up, camera use (zoom, focus, shot match), camera talkback.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lighting – check picture exposure and colour vision, interpretation of mood and look required. Follow programme scripts and lighting cues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RF Systems – carry out site surveys and resulting documentation, rig and repair RF cables and use web browser interfaces and terminal server programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Networking Technologies - configuring equipment to work with an existing network, using analysis tools to fault find and adding external storage systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours &lt;/strong&gt;– It is vital that an OB Engineer is a team player, an excellent communicator and is resilient and able to deal with challenging working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will also show in their behaviour&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-awareness – show empathy to job roles in a media production environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Location awareness - embracing the opportunities a location provides rather than fighting the constraints and challenges encountered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication awareness – choosing the most appropriate language for a given situation – this encompasses talkback etiquette.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Being prepared – thinking ahead, planning and asking questions to ensure the right level of preparedness of location.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Client awareness – show sensitivity to the pressures of budget, time and location.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications gained&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Post Graduate Diploma in Outside Broadcasting Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and mathematics will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be a full review of this Standard before June 2018, but could happen sooner given the fast- changing technology and practices required within the sector.&lt;/p&gt;",
