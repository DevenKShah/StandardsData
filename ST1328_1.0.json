  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Polymer processing technicians work in the process manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A polymer is a substance or material made of long repeating chains of molecules. There are several types of polymers. They have different properties: light, heavy, strong, tough, and flexible, depending on the type of molecules bonded and how they are bonded. They are used for a wide variety of purposes in both everyday consumer products and highly demanding technical applications. Elastomer and rubber for example, are used for tyres and components such as seals and gaskets. PVC is used for water pipes, window frames, and cable insulation. Nylon and polyester are used in clothing. And plastics are used in mobile phones, computer hardware, automotive, medical devices, aerospace, disability aides, water bottles, and vacuum cleaners.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Polymer processing technicians produce polymer products to a specification. They work in a production facility - often on a large scale, using a range of machinery, control systems and engineering equipment. Products are made using continuous or in batch processes. Polymer processing technicians set up or configure equipment and tooling and prepare materials for processing. They run and monitor the process, adjusting parameters. They use unique technologies and processes such as extrusion, blow moulding, thermoforming, rotational moulding, injection moulding, internal mixing, and calendering. They undertake quality control, complete work records, and participate in improvement. They may also complete preventative maintenance and prepare polymer process equipment for maintenance and overhaul.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work with other members of the production team. They also have contact with people from other functions such as, process engineers, maintenance engineers, laboratory staff, supply chain staff, and warehouse staff. They may also have contact with external people such as customers, service providers, suppliers, and regulators. They usually report to a production manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must ensure that the process and products meet quality specifications and are produced to schedule. They must comply with health and safety regulations and procedures including wearing personal protection equipment (PPE). They also need to meet environmental and sustainability regulations and procedures – minimising waste and recycling materials. They may work as part of a small or large manufacturing team. They work with minimal supervision and are responsible for the quality of their own work. They may work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;",
