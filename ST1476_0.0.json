  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in many contexts, from small legal firms on the high street to large multi-nationals. They can work in the private or public sector. They can work within in-house legal departments, legal services firms, not-for-profit sector and charities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to give legal advice on non-routine legal matters. They also support other legal professionals including on reserved matters and aspects of law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of stakeholders from private or corporate clients to banks, lawyers, court officials or government bodies. They work with internal stakeholders such as senior leaders and managers or financial teams. Advanced paralegals mainly provide legal support independently but may also work under supervision on reserved legal matters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing or delegating work and requests from many people at once, as well as having their own duties. They may prioritise and delegate key tasks, guiding others in completing legal and administrative tasks. The ability to work under pressure and to meet deadlines is essential. People will be relying upon the advanced paralegal to not only complete their tasks but also collaborate with others. An advanced paralegal will make judgements within specified limits on legal or working matters. Paralegals at all levels interact with clients, lawyers and other stakeholders such as the police, courts, government or regulatory bodies. An advanced paralegal will carry out their interactions with more autonomy and reliance on their personal judgement than more junior paralegals. Advanced paralegals convey complex messages and data clearly, sometimes in emotionally charged or difficult circumstances. They will support and sometimes lead internal teams. They use problem-solving skills to help get the best outcomes for the client and their organisation. Some advanced paralegals may be doing their work on behalf of their own clients. They may be &quot;fee-earning&quot; and take responsibility for the commercial impact of their work whether in terms of profitability or value for money. Advanced paralegals work in a regulated context and so high professional and ethical standards are vital. Advanced paralegals are self-directing. They identify the scope of their legal research, synthesize ideas and analyse complex data, keeping a high level of precision and attention to detail. Advanced paralegal work can include tasks such as drafting legal documents from template and bespoke formats, contacting clients and assisting with meetings and governance. Advanced paralegals are usually office based, although they may assist at court or attend meetings with clients at off-site locations. The role can vary widely depending on the practice area. For example, if working in conveyancing then an advanced paralegal is less likely to have much face-to-face contact with clients. However, if assisting on criminal work, they may need to assist lawyers attending court and police stations and talk to suspects. Advanced paralegals qualified to work in criminal law may also be Police Station Representatives. Advanced paralegals will administer data and records. They will review documents and produce legal documents using digital tools. They will handle confidential and sensitive data daily and so recognising data protection requirements is critical to the role. This extends to recognising the risks to data from cybercrime and the need to be vigilant. Advanced paralegals interpret and use financial data when assisting clients and other stakeholders. They ensure that any tasks involving monies are carried out in compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Advanced paralegals can go on to be partners in law firms, heads of legal departments in the private or public sector. They may decide to form their own legal services company providing legal services direct to litigants in person. In some instances, in the lower courts, for example, some tribunals and small claims courts, advanced paralegals may be granted the rights of audience. This means that they can advocate for their own clients directly.&lt;/p&gt;",
