  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the games and interactive entertainment industries where programmers create software designed for entertainment. This includes organisations which develop games for games consoles, desktop computers, mobile devices, websites and TVs. This is a core and options apprenticeship standard, which means that apprentices must complete the core, and one option out of Game software programmer or Game technology programmer. Companies which employ Game software programmers range from large, international studios employing hundreds of staff, to small indie studios made up of a few developers. Game technology programmers are often employed by hardware developers (e.g. console manufacturers), middleware providers (e.g. game engine developers) as well as large game studios, and would include specialists like server programmers in mobile game development companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to program reliable and efficient software within the&#160; constraints of real-time graphical environments running on contemporary gaming platforms. Such programmers lead the development of technical systems which feed directly or indirectly into the player experience of a game. These technical systems could range from gameplay mechanics (e.g. programming a system of different attack moves and their effect on enemies) to asset pipelines (e.g. engineering tools which process geometry data in order to support a character customisation system) and custom technologies (e.g. a new graphics rendering system for displaying realistic-looking dragon scales). They collaboratively plan and coordinate the delivery of their work within a larger team and provide technical insight to a broad spectrum of creative disciplines. They create and maintain appropriate technical standards and stay informed of the latest technical requirements for gaming platforms, exploring new technologies and their potential application within the business. They diagnose and fix problems in complex systems that involve many interacting factors, initiating changes to software architectures to support an evolving design. Game software programmers work on a specific gaming title and their audience are the consumers of that product (gamers). Game programmers select and apply game engines and tools to realise a game design. They are responsible for the development of bespoke asset pipelines and work collaboratively with other developers to maximise the collaborative value of the teamâ€™s effort to the player experience. Game technology programmers work on the technologies that underpin videogames and their audience are other game developers. Game technology programmers design and create libraries, engines and tools which target specific hardware architectures or gaming platforms. They initiate and lead the development of standardised technologies and work collaboratively with a wide user-base to inform and improve their design and documentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a diverse creative community of developers, providing technical authority and insight to Game programmers, Designers, Producers, Artists, Animators, Audio engineers, Quality Assurance (QA) staff and Project managers. They may also interact with external stakeholders, such as publishers, platform holders and external QA. They work independently and collaboratively as required, reporting to Development directors, Technical directors, Producers, and senior staff. This applies to both options. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading the design and development of bespoke technical systems which affect the allocation of significant project resources. They are responsible for planning and coordinating the delivery of work for themselves and junior programmers and provide technical insight and leadership to a range of creative disciplines within a larger team. They create and maintain technical standards across the organisation and its clients. This includes technical requirements needed to submit titles to console platforms. They lead research into new technologies, identifying potential opportunities for their application. They work under limited direct supervision, responsible for the quality and accuracy of their own work and sometimes the work of others. They ensure work is completed within agreed timescales and within budgets. As their work includes communicating with external stakeholders, they must present a professional image of their employer and themselves. This applies to both options.&lt;/p&gt;",
