The variety of goods and services that procurement professionals are responsible for is vast: goods could range from buying a plane to negotiating new stationery supply.

This will be supported by the attainment of a Level 4 Diploma with the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp;amp; Supply (CIPS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job roles in this area include: Commercial support, Commercial analyst, Sourcing executive, Procurement operations support, Buyer, assistant buyer, Commercial relationship support, Commissioning and Performance monitoring officer, Framework management support, Contract associate, Contract support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following explains the knowledge, skills and behaviours required from a successful individual on completion of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Context of procurement and supply&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How an organisation’s money is spent, including the organisation’s own rules on managing budgets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The difference between public and private sector procurement life-cycles and how they fit into the&#160;organisation’s structure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pre- procurement and early market engagement&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Show understanding of the market, regulatory environment, supplier and service landscape before beginning the tendering process.
