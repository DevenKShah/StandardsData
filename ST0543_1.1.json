  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clinical Dental Technicians (CDT) are General Dental Council (GDC) registered dental professionals who provide a complete dentures direct to patients and other dental devices such as partial dentures to the prescription of a dentist. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The CDT role fits between that of a dental technician and a dentist.&amp;nbsp; Like a dental technician, they are able to make dentures in a laboratory but, unlike a dental technician, they have direct contact with patients.&amp;nbsp; Like a dentist, they are able to work in the mouth, taking impressions for the edentulous(1), dentate or patient with implants.&amp;nbsp; However, they are not able to prescribe to patients who have teeth and therefore work to prescriptions from the dentist as required. The CDT examines, assesses, provides treatment, gives advice and designs, manufactures, modifies and repairs custom-made dental appliances. Working as part of the dental team, they refer endentulous patients to a dentist if they need a treatment plan or if there are oral health concerns.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Patients with natural teeth or implants must see a dentist before the CDT begins treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Day to day activities include:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;assessing patients or contributing to patient assessment including taking detailed dental and relevant medical history&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;treating acute oral conditions including prescribing and providing complete dentures directly to patients&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;responding to treatment plans and working closely with patient to identify the best solution for them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;providing and fitting complete or partial dentures or other dental devices on prescription from a dentist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;taking impressions, designing and/or manufacturing of a range of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;fitting, modifying and repairing a range of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;taking and processing radiographs or other images&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;advising and encouraging oral hygiene and care of dental devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprentices.&amp;nbsp; You must be a GDC registered dental technician to do this apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;GDC approved level 5 qualification. Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional registration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clinical Dental Technicians are statutorily regulated health professionals.&amp;nbsp; They recognise and act within the General Dental Council (GDC) standards, ethical guidance, information governance and relevant laws.&amp;nbsp; On successful completion of an acceptable qualification the apprentice can apply to register with the GDC as a Clinical Dental Technician.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;5&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;Typically 24 months&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date: &lt;/strong&gt;After 3 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;258&quot; style=&quot;width: 258px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;449&quot; style=&quot;width: 449px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;258&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be trustworthy, caring, honest, responsible and committed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;449&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will treat people with dignity and respect.
