  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in all healthcare settings including, primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, independent and private healthcare sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide excellent patient care by obtaining images of a high diagnostic quality using a range of high cost and complex imaging equipment. This will include imaging using x-rays and cross-sectional imaging methods (Computed Tomography or CT), fluoroscopy and Interventional Radiology and will be able to assist in other imaging modalities such as Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Breast Imaging and Nuclear Medicine. Diagnostic Radiographers work with a broad range of patients, e.g. patients who may have mental and/or physical disabilities or be distressed, children and the terminally ill. They work independently to assess, authorise, obtain consent and undertake individual examination requests for radiography procedures. They will critique images and determine appropriate actions. The work is physically and mentally demanding and involves direct patient contact, which can be of a personal nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, their carers, members of the public and other healthcare staff e.g. porters, nurses, other allied health professionals, doctors, external contractors, engineers and medical physicists etc. They will primarily work in diagnostic imaging departments in hospitals (inpatients and outpatients), but also provide mobile imaging on Wards, including the Intensive Care Unit, Neonatal Unit, Emergency Department and Operating Theatres. Diagnostic Radiographers may also provide imaging in stand- alone satellite units.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the safe use of imaging equipment and the safe conduct of examinations, including the radiation protection of patients, themselves, staff and visitors. As registered autonomous practitioners they are accountable both professionally and legally for their own actions and for those operating under their supervision as they deliver safe and compassionate care. Work may be undertaken independently or as part of a team. They may refer to another healthcare professional for advice; however, this may not always be available at night in smaller organisations or in satellite departments. They are expected to contribute to a 24-hour, 7-day week imaging service with varying shift patterns and on call service and, on occasion, may be the sole provider of imaging services for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;",
