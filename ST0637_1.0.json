  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 1: Occupation profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Packaging professionals lead on technical packaging delivery programmes and projects for a multitude of products including food and drink, consumer electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and automotive components. The fundamental role of packaging is to protect, preserve and promote the contents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Packaging professionals may be employed in many industry sectors: filling and packing, design, product manufacture and processing, environmental management, transport and storage, retail, print and chemical manufacture to name but a few; with employers ranging from small design companies through to global conglomerates employing many thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical duties include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;generating new packaging products in response to briefs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ensuring that packaging developed meets set requirements, legislation and specifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;producing samples to optimise the end product; different materials, formats and designs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;running trials to check packaging for suitability and performance under various conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;controlling specifications, production and quality standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;undertaking technical evaluations, selections, and negotiating with suppliers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;identifying opportunities for technological improvement, selecting products from suppliers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;working with market research professionals to translate consumer insight into packaging design features&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;identifying packaging opportunities and championing them to stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;identifying and optimising solutions that improve sustainability and minimise environmental impact&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;managing complex projects to time and budget&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically, packaging professionals will operate with multiple stakeholders, reporting into research and development (R&amp;amp;D), technical, operations or supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Projects worked on might be as simple as a small efficiency saving and optimisation of a pack system with no real capital value, through to a global brand redesign requiring new manufacturing lines, pack tooling and a plethora of staff with interactions globally, spanning different departments, involving spends in the millions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working environment is typically office based, with frequent excursion into the production environment, warehouse, or to the extremes of the supply chain where the consumers might be located.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles: Packaging Operations Manager, Packaging Development Manager, Packaging Project Manager, Packaging Innovation Technologist, Senior Packaging Technologist, Packaging Specialist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Green job titles: &lt;img style=&quot;width: 19px;

preserve the product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Requirements of packaging: environmental consideration, economical appropriateness and use-ability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The impact and measures of packaging on the environment and strategies to reduce its impact e.g. reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, energy and water consumption and carbon emissions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Materials science: properties, testing, applications and interaction with the product; hygiene, odour, migration, corrosion and their impact on product shelf life.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Requirements to manage the storage, transportation and conditions required for packaging and finished goods.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The different types of finished pack testing, including functionality and consumer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Machinery technologies: different types of filling and packaging performance; collate, form, fill, seal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conversion technologies: the process of raw material to end packaging.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The interactions between machine, process, materials and product e.g. coefficient of friction, static.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Line design and the concept of production efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of budgetary control, cost analysis e.g. costs of goods, total delivered costs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customer and consumer requirements throughout the package’s lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Principles of marketing as it relates to packaging (4 P’s: place, price, product and promotion).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Legislation and standards relating to packaging, e.g. Packaging Essential Requirements, dangerous goods, packaging waste, good manufacturing practice, labelling.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Value chain analysis and the principles of continuous improvement techniques, e.g. DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control), 5S.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Standard packaging formats covering primary, secondary and tertiary, including ancillaries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The role of quality assurance and control in packaging; the types of quality checks undertaken throughout the lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Packaging documentation, including how to write/create and interpret a brief, specification, technical drawing and report.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Printing and decorative technologies and their applications e.g. flexo, litho, gravure and digital.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Artwork, graphics in packaging, including artwork creation and reprographics, how to test colour and finishes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of packaging design, including structural, functional and inclusive design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The packaging innovation and development workflow and process including design, prototyping, approvals, translations, timescales, certifications and involvement of stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supplier management, including contractual agreements, procurement, standards for approving suppliers (ethical, quality accreditation, audit), methods of ensuring operational compliance (Key Performance Indicators, scorecards).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of project management, including critical paths, Gantt charts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Innovation in packaging, including intellectual property, open innovation, scout and horizon scanning, trends and insights, desk research;
