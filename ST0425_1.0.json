  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Broadcast, Media and Entertainment industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians will typically work for a broadcaster or media services supplier or broadcast equipment supplier/manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure the reliability and integrity of broadcast and media systems critical to the delivery of TV, radio and online services; in a broadcast industry which operates 24/7.&#160; It’s fast paced, dynamic and constantly changing.&#160; Technicians need to be able to respond quickly to problems, faults and the loss or impairment of services to ensure customers experience the best possible service.&#160; Broadcast and Media Systems Technicians need to know and understand the maintenance characteristics that are particularly critical to the broadcast and media equipment or system, including electrical, electronic, mechanical, software, environmental and ergonomics. They are also responsible for ensuring broadcast and media systems modifications and upgrades are delivered in line with agreed timescales and to industry specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with broadcast technical operators, broadcast engineers, customers and suppliers. They will be expected to work autonomously and take sole responsibility for making decisions about ongoing maintenance versus replacement and the implications of this such as cost, downtime and reliability. They will also be expected to take ownership to resolve and/or escalate faults and incidents following the correct company procedures. Broadcast and Media Systems Technicians must also be able to provide technical advice and support to users and operators of broadcast and media systems in line with service level agreements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role could be located in a broadcast or operations centre, at customer premises, playout operations, outside broadcast units, transmitter sites, production control rooms or IP Networks or Software Support. Operating and maintaining these systems is demanding,and may require out of hours working through shift working or on call rotas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for operating and maintaining the broadcast and media systems which underpin the media and entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Core duties include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carrying out planned maintenance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carrying out corrective maintenance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complying with Health and Safety&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining Broadcast and Media Systems test equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertaking Broadcast and Media Systems testing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing technical advice and support to users and operators of Broadcast and Media Systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data management and reporting for Broadcast and Media Systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining professional competence in Broadcast and Media Systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supporting system modifications and upgrades&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operating broadcast and media transfer/playout or export&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
