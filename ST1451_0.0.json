  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the surface mining and mineral extraction sectors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to plan and carry out blasting operations. This will include surveying of blast areas using laser surveying equipment as well as drone-based photogrammetry, the design of drill patterns, the design of blast loading specifications, loading and firing the blast, and environmental monitoring. They would also work to identify and deal with any misfires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of colleagues, such as managers, shotfirers, surveyors, engineers, and other operational personnel. They would also interact with external stakeholders, such as the quarry operators where the blasting is carried out, local councils, and other regulatory bodies. They would usually be based on site, covering multiple quarries in a specific region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for complying with specific health and safety legislation, for example the Quarries Regulations 1999 and Explosives Regulations 2014. They would also need to design blasts and carry out monitoring to ensure compliance with environmental restrictions applied to a quarry through local authority planning consents. They would be responsible for the safe design, loading and firing of the blast.&lt;/p&gt;",
