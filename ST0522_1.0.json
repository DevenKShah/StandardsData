  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A youth worker is someone who uses rights-based, person-centred relationships to engage with young people to promote their social, emotional, and personal development using informal education approaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation can be found in a range of settings where young people are present, including (but not limited to) youth projects, educational settings, health environments and faith sector. The settings may be informal, such as youth clubs, activity-based or social action projects, or more formal, such as Local Authority Children&#39;s Services, hospitals, schools, alternative education provisions or youth custody. In this occupation and context, &#39;youth&#39; refers to young people aged 11 to 19, or up to the age of 25 for those with additional needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to enable young people to develop holistically, working with young people to facilitate personal, social and educational development. This is to enable them to develop their voice, influence and place in society, and reach their individual and collective potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working with young people to plan, deliver and evaluate the youth work curriculum and programmes with individuals and groups. They will receive supervision from their line manager but will also work autonomously and manage other staff, which may include volunteers, youth support/assistants, youth support workers, peer mentors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may be responsible for building management, such as youth clubs and youth project premises or mobile units depending on the size or structure of the organisation. They will be responsible for managing projects (including budgets) and maintaining appropriate financial and other administrative records.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with voluntary, charitable and statutory services, such as youth services, education, health, social and community provisions. They will also engage with a range of other partners and stakeholders, such as funders, families, and allied professionals.&lt;/p&gt;",
