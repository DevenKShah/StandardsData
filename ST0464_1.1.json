However, starts on the apprenticeship will only be possible once a suitable end-point assessment organisation (EPAO) has obtained Ofqual recognition. Once the EPAO has obtained Ofqual recognition, funding for apprentice starts will be permitted and this message will be removed.; We do not want any apprentice to be disadvantaged so we have applied a temporary dispensation to the ST0464 Smart home technician end-point assessment plan&nbsp;(EPA) to both version V1.0 (AP01) and V1.1 for this apprenticeship.&nbsp;The dispensation will last until 30 September 2025The dispensation may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner, or the dispensation is no longer necessary. If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this standard and (or) EPA, you must contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk for further details before commencing with any development work as the current dispensation may impact upon feasibility.",
