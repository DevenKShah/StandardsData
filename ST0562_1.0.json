The L&amp;amp;D Practitioner will typically have expertise and competence in their specific field whether it be technical, vocational or behavioural (e.g. use of software, food preparation, working in teams). They link the learning within their area of responsibility to business objectives and performance, understanding the learning cycle and working by it. The role can be more specialist, with a focus on and requiring in-depth expertise in a specific area of L&amp;amp;D such as learning design, e-learning or digital / blended learning. Whichever of these is an area of focus; the L&amp;amp;D Practitioner is future focused, understands the business context / culture and has a good grounding across the whole training and learning cycles.

The dispensation will last from 29/05/24 to 24/05/25, but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.\nEnd-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.\nThe key changes are:\nFor Assessment Method 1 (EPA 1 – Work-based project with professional discussion), organisations can use their own, suitably-qualified assessor to observe the training being delivered by the apprentice, or watch a recording of it, and complete a witness statement commenting on how the apprentice demonstrated competence of Skills S6, S7, S9 and S10.\nApprentices can submit the witness statement in the appendices of their work-based report instead of a video recording, along with any other supplementary evidence (e.g. resource planning, sessions plans, evaluation report of the training session), to support the assessment of S6, S7, S9 and S10.\nThis dispensation applies to agreed cohorts only. EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as they are detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.\nPlease contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity.",
