The LST role is pivotal to the success of traineeship and apprenticeship programmes, in delivering effective vocational education and training that meets both learners’ and employers’ needs.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;LSTs teach young people and adults within all parts of the ETS, including: work based/independent training provision; further, adult and higher education; offender-learning; and the voluntary sector.&#160; LSTs are responsible for planning and delivering learning that is current, relevant, challenging, and that inspires learners to engage and achieve their full potential.&#160; LSTs collaborate closely with colleagues and other ETS professionals in supporting learner progress. LSTs ensure the physical, psychological and social wellbeing of learners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The LST apprenticeship requires development of the following professional behaviours, skills and knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional behaviours.
