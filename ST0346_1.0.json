They involve the integration of live-action footage and computer generated imagery to create images which look realistic but would be dangerous, costly, or simply impossible to capture during live-action shooting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Assistant technical directors (ATDs) may perform a diverse series of technical support functions in order to ensure the smooth running of a&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;visual effects project. They are responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;supporting and troubleshooting the pipeline and workflow tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;providing technical assistance to people in creative departments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;managing data and resources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ATDs utilise a variety of industry standard graphical applications, scripting languages and operating systems. They may support projects by gathering artist requirements, designing solutions and coding small-scale tools using established employer workflow requirements. They are expected to work well within a team and to be good communicators and problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Upon successful completion of their apprenticeship the individual could have a diverse career progression. Some may progress to become Pipeline Technical Directors, Software Developers, Riggers, Technical Directors or FX Artists. Some will eventually become Supervisors in their field. ATDs will typically be employed by a range of small to large post-production companies servicing the British and International Film, Television and Commercial industries. They will usually be based in an office environment working on television commercials, television series and feature films.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width:
