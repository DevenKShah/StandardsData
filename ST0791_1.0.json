  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering sector working in the catering industry, in a variety of sites that prepare food in kitchens using commercial catering equipment. Sites include restaurants, public houses, hotels, cafes, schools, hospitals, prisons, care homes, Ministry of Defence sites and many more. They work for catering equipment distributors, catering equipment maintenance specialists, catering equipment manufacturers or importers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to install, commission, maintain and repair commercial catering equipment, such as combination ovens, fryers, grills and griddles, cooking ranges, dishwashers, microwave ovens etc. Equipment may be gas or electrical and may involve plumbing and electronic controls. Technicians’ work on commercial refrigeration equipment will be limited to mechanical and electrical work and will not include any work relating to refrigerant circuit. Some technicians specialise in certain types of equipment, the majority will work across a wide spectrum. Depending on the work required, they may spend the day at one site or working across a number of venues, working to deadlines. They will travel to sites and might need to work shifts or unsociable hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installations involve unpacking and in some cases assembling equipment, connecting in accordance with the equipment manufacturer’s instructions to suitable services (gas, electricity, water and drainage) and commissioning. Where an installation involves the removal of equipment, they disconnect the redundant item, remove it to a safe area for disposal and make safe any services no longer required. On maintenance visits, they visually inspect the equipment, check the services for any problems, carry out maintenance tasks as specified by the manufacturer, and test the equipment is functioning as designed. On repair visits, they establish the problem from the customer, check the faulty item to confirm the problem, diagnose the fault, adjust or repair or replace faulty components, and test the equipment after repair to ensure that it is working correctly. They need to be qualified and registered with Gas Safe for the types of appliances they are working on and retain their currency. They will typically need a driving license for private/light goods vehicles. In addition, it is likely that they will need a disclosure and baring service (DBS) certification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with venue personnel, such as chefs, catering managers, facilities managers, managers/owners and kitchen staff. Personnel from equipment manufacturers technical support services, and equipment and spares suppliers’ sales and technical staff. They may also liaise with Environmental Health Officers and other trades personnel, such as builders, electricians etc. Internally, they will interact with company management, office staff and other technicians.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for planning their schedule and logistics to meet customers’ requirements and location.

They must ensure the quality and accuracy of work carried out, ensuring the health, safety and welfare of self and others - working in line with legislation. They have the authority to determine action, including the disconnection or isolation of equipment.
