  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in a range of play settings offering different models of Playwork. Most Playworkers are employed in the voluntary or public sector, while others work in the private sector. Playworkers may work in local community settings, such as Before and After School Clubs, Adventure Playgrounds and Mobile Play Provision, for example a Playbus. They may also offer play sessions in Women’s Refuges, Prisons and Hospitals, as well as play ranger sessions in open spaces such as parks and woodlands. Playschemes are also offered in sport and leisure centres where Playworkers may be employed.&#160; Playwork jobs roles vary according to the type of service being provided and children being supported.&#160; Typical employers include local councils and government, charities and voluntary management committees, private companies offering After School/Breakfast/Holiday clubs and private day care nurseries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to care for and support children in taking responsibility for themselves and their own playing whilst creating a stimulating and adventurous space for children to learn and explore in their own way, following their own intent, ideas and inventions. The focus of all play settings is on child-directed and child-controlled play, with Playworkers planning for and providing an ever-changing environment that allows children to choose what and how they play. Playworkers observe and monitor this play for children’s development, engagement and safety, both physical and emotional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playworkers subtly observe play rather than overtly leading activities in order to:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;understand individual children’s needs and behaviours, as well as their likes and wants in playing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;support individual children’s emerging capabilities and competences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;understand how to better resource the play environment so that children are provided with opportunities to engage with the elements and their senses to explore, create and change the world around them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;reflect on how their adult presence is impacting on the children’s play, in both positive and negative ways, to ensure that children can play and explore without interruption or the necessity to seek approval or permission. Reflections are undertaken individually and as a team in order to improve the quality of play provision and to improve their own practice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;undertake dynamic risk-benefit assessments during play sessions to support children’s playful risk-taking. This includes being aware of generally accepted abilities relating to ages and stages, but not being bound by them in order to support individual speed of development. Playworkers support children to naturally stretch their boundaries physically, mentally, socially and emotionally, whilst balancing both the risks and the benefits that this incurs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playworkers use the outcomes of their observations to make better informed decisions about whether their intervention is needed and how to do this without taking away from children’s own faculties, abilities and growing expertise. In doing so, Playworkers develop significant and non-hierarchical relationships with the children they support.&lt;span&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Children and young people and families from a range of backgrounds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Team members&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthcare Professionals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Police and other members of the Emergency Services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Child Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Social Services &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Youth and Community Workers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Representatives from the relevant Local Authorities &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Local residents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Park Wardens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playworkers need to have excellent communication skills to support children and their families. Depending on the setting they work in, they may also interact with a range of people in the public and professional community.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team of Playworkers managed by a Level 3 Team leader. Operating as a team, they support children in their play, are an advocate for play to parents and local community members, regularly resource and create a range of stimulating play spaces, undertake risk-benefit assessments and contribute to ongoing reflective practice both personally and as a team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main varying factor in everyday Playwork practice is the type of setting. They will implement the organisation’s policies and procedures, reporting all difficulties and concerns to the line manager. They will have an understanding of different theories of play and Playwork and know when and how to implement these to support children’s individual needs. They will also participate in all necessary training and continuing professional development, maintaining an up-to-date knowledge of play and the legal requirements for an environment where children play. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working as part of a team, Playworkers ensure that the play area is operating to legal standards, undertaking all necessary checks on the environment and resources in order to protect the health and well-being of all children using the facilities. They also ensure that play spaces and activities are made accessible and equipment is adjusted where necessary for children with additional needs and/or impairments, providing opportunity for all children to reach their full play potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playworkers may also co-ordinate and take part in off-site trips and overnight residentials.&lt;span&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
