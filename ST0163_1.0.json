They require strong analytical skills and a practical approach to interpret technical information. They use specific, complex software tools to undertake a wide range of project controls tasks, including: identifying the right data for scrutinising progress; setting baseline targets; tracking progress and performance; forecasting trends; identifying, modelling and anticipating deviations from baseline; assessing the impact of design/construction changes; and using insight to recommend early preventative and remedial actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Project Controls includes the technical disciplines of estimating, planning, scheduling and cost engineering for which this apprenticeship gives a comprehensive grounding leading to roles such as project controller, estimator, planner, scheduler and cost engineer. Typically job holders work in large project teams on complex projects in sectors such as construction, manufacturing, engineering, energy and infrastructure – where detailed progress /performance tracking, and an understanding of on-site hazards, health and safety requirements and compliance is critical. This hands-on role is crucial to ensuring the successful delivery of complex projects and a shortage of skilled professionals provides opportunities for a secure, fulfilling long-term career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With additional training the Project Controls Technician could also progress to more specialist roles in areas such as project controls, planning, scheduling, estimating, cost control, risk and quality and ultimately a role as project controls manager or director&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;u&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sted Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Set by individual employers, entry requirements will typically include a minimum of 5 GCSE grades A* - C (or equivalent qualifications) including mathematics; English (Language).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical knowledge&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Project Controls Technician requires an understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project controls: &lt;/strong&gt;the project life-cycle, breakdown structures, the relationship between time and cost, quality and risk, how project controls is critical to successful project delivery&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical information: &lt;/strong&gt;how to review and interpret technical information from different sources e.g. engineering drawings, manufacturing plans or construction plans to develop the scope for control&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stimating practice: &lt;/strong&gt;classes of estimate, how to interpret technical requirements and specifications to develop

planning and scheduling, key terms and processes used to produce control schedules, how to interpret the technical requirements to produce a workable control schedule including development of logic networks, dependencies, critical paths, resource management, levelling and smoothing and impact of uncertainty and risk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost engineering practice: &lt;/strong&gt;key terms and processes related to preparing control budgets, cash flow, cost control and cost engineering
