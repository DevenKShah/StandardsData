A laboratory technician may carry out both routine and one-off laboratory testing and perform a variety of technical support functions across the organisation. In any context working safety and ethically is paramount and many companies operate under highly regulated conditions because of the need to control the quality and safety of products, for example medicines. Laboratory technicians are expected to work both individually and as part of a laboratory team. They are able to work with minimum supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work that is undertaken. They are proactive in finding solutions to problems and identifying areas for improving the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Skills &amp;amp; Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A laboratory technician can:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work safely in a laboratory, maintaining excellent housekeeping whilst following appropriate safety, environment and risk management systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;Understand and follow quality procedures to meet the requirements of quality standards relevant to the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;Understand the internal and external regulatory environment pertinent to the sector and the employer and comply with regulations proficiently.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;Prepare for laboratory tasks using the appropriate scientific techniques, procedures and methods.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;Perform laboratory tasks following specified methodologies, such as Standard Operating Procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate technical competence in the use of specified instrumentation and laboratory equipment, including calibration where required.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Produce reliable, accurate data and keep accurate records of laboratory work undertaken and results.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyse, interpret and evaluate data and identify results requiring further investigation seeking advice of senior colleagues as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand and apply statistical techniques for data presentation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate scientific information appropriately, including the use of Laboratory Information Management systems, either digital or paper based.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recognise problems and apply appropriate scientific methods to identify causes and achieve solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Participate in continuous performance improvement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and apply theoretical knowledge of relevant science and technology required for the sector &amp;amp; job role&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the business environment in which the company operates including personal role within the organisation, ethical practice and codes of conduct.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15.&lt;/strong&gt; A laboratory technician also demonstrates the required attitudes, behaviours and interpersonal skills associated with the professional workplace including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;communicate effectively using a full range of skills: speaking; listening; writing; body language; presentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work and interact effectively within a team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work independently and take responsibility for initiating and completing tasks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;understand impact of work on others, especially where related to diversity and equality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;time management and ability to complete work to schedule&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ability to handle change and respond to change management processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without a level 2 English and mathematics will need to achieve this level prior to completion of their apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices must complete a level 3 or 4 qualification in a science or technology discipline relevant to their occupation, which is recognised for professional registration by RSciTech, prior to completing the end-point assessment. Example qualifications are detailed in the assessment plan for this standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to professional registration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship is recognised by the relevant professional bodies at Registered Science Technician (RSciTech) level, for which there is a requirement that the technician will participate in subsequent continuing professional development on completion of the apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;June 2018&lt;/p&gt;",
