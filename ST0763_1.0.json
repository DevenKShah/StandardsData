  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in any sector or organisation that analyses high-volume or complex data sets using advanced computational methods, such as Agriculture, Environmental, Business, Leisure, Travel, Hospitality, Education, Public Services, Construction, Creative and Design, Media, Engineering, Technology, Manufacturing, Health, Science, Legal, Finance, Accountancy, Sales, Marketing, Procurement, Transport and Logistics&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to discover and devise new data-driven AI solutions to automate and optimise business processes and to support, augment and enhance human decision-making. AI Data Specialists carry out applied research in order to create innovative data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to business problems within the constraints of a specific business context. They work with datasets that are too large, too complex, too varied or too fast, that render traditional approaches and techniques unsuitable or unfeasible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;AI Data Specialists champion AI and its applications within their organisation and promote adoption of novel tools and technologies, informed by current data governance frameworks and ethical best practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They deliver better value products and processes to the business by advancing the use of data, machine learning and artificial intelligence; using novel research to increase the quality and value of data within the organisation and across the industry. They communicate, internally and externally, with technology leaders and third parties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a broad spectrum of people and collaborates with, and provides technical authority and insight to, a diverse business community of Senior Leaders Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Statisticians, Analysts, Research and Development Scientists and Academics. Their interactions extend to working externally alongside other organisations, such as local and international governments, businesses, policy regulators, academic research scientists and non-technical audiences. They will work independently and collaboratively as required, reporting to Heads of Data, Chief Architects, Company Directors, Product Managers and senior decision makers within any organisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for initiating new projects in an agile environment, and collaboratively maintaining technical standards within AI solutions applied across the organisation and its customers. They lead research into AI and its potential application within the business. They collaborate with and influence policy and operations teams to identify areas where AI solutions can create new business opportunities and efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;",
