Premises include houses, schools, offices, airports hospitals, factories and construction sites. The is varied work; tilers utilise and install a wide range of ceramic and natural stone tiles using different techniques. Tilers work both internally and externally; they work individually and/or as part of a team. They have a good knowledge of tiles, backgrounds and ancillary products and understand and comply with statutory, safety and environmental requirements. They are good problem solvers and communicators and are able to interact effectively with colleagues, clients and associated trades.

This timescale may reduce if an apprentice is part qualified on entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date : &lt;/strong&gt;The Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
