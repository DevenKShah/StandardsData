They play a pivotal part in reducing the risk of amputation, infection, pain, deformity and hospital admissions. They will undertake a range of podiatry interventions including wound care, routine skin and nail care, nail surgery, scalpel work or care for long term conditions. They provide musculoskeletal assessment and then instigate a treatment plan to improve or enhance movement or reduce pain. They prescribe functional insoles for the management of foot / lower limb conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day to day activities&lt;/strong&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;assessing patients, differentially diagnosing conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;agreeing and negotiating treatment plans in partnership with the patient&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;treating lower limb conditions such as nail and skin pathology, musculoskeletal conditions, pain and wounds&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;dealing with people with challenging medical and social conditions and their complications, providing evidence-based interventions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;offering holistic patient-centred health education&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;clinical management and administration including keeping records, appointment management, stock control and maintaining the clinical environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 3 A levels or equivalent access qualification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be required to complete a Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) approved BSc (Honours) or (where the apprentice already holds a level 6 honours degree) a pre-registration MSc in Podiatry.
