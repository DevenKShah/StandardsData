Legislation or policy frameworks may be international, national or local, and include (but are not limited to) the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979, National Planning Policy Framework, Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017, Ecclesiastical Exemption Order 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of clients, colleagues and stakeholders in the public, private and third sectors, within organisations of any size.
