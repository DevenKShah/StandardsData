  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Civil Engineers provide technical and management input to develop design solutions for complex civil engineering problems. They will work as part of a team of engineers and other construction professionals through all lifecycle stages of development, design, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning of civil engineering infrastructure. &#160;A Civil Engineer will be required to have a broad skills base to work in areas including sustainable construction, structural integrity, geotechnics (engineering behaviour of earth materials), materials, tunnelling, marine and coastal engineering, water, waste management, flood management, transportation and power. &#160;A Civil Engineer might work in public and private sector organisations including local authorities, central government departments and agencies, engineering consultancy practices, contracting firms and research and development organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;A Civil Engineer’s work comprises:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project delivery&lt;/strong&gt; – An awareness of business, client and end user needs throughout the project lifecycle. Plan and manage tasks, people and commercial budgets to deliver quality assured outputs on time and to client and industry specifications, standards and guidance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt; – Define engineering and other constraints, identify risks and how these may be resolved through design. Develop safe and sustainable technical solutions and provide guidance to others by producing design models, calculations, reports and drawings, surveying a site, using applicable analysis and relevant codes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; – Identify and use applicable digital solutions, other data gathering tools and tests to solve technical problems. Evaluate the effectiveness of the analysis, refine as required, and apply to an integrated solution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt; – Determine construction methods and technical aspects of site activities. Identify and mitigate risk, develop and operate quality systems and health, safety and risk management procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprenticeship candidates will typically have at least three A levels at Grades A*-C including Mathematics and Physical Science or their equivalent or will have completed a Level 3 Apprenticeship as a Civil Engineering Technician.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 60-66 months but this will depend on the previous experience of the apprentice and access to opportunities to gain the full range of competence.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 6 Apprenticeship.&#160; On completion the apprentice will have fully satisfied the requirements for registration as an Incorporated Engineer by the relevant professional engineering institution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful apprentices will gain a BSc or BEng civil engineering degree which is accredited by the Joint Board of Moderators.&#160; (The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ice.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Institution of Civil Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.istructe.org/Pages/SeDefault.aspx&quot;&gt;Institution of Structural Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iht.org/&quot;&gt;Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ihie.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Institute of Highway Engineers&lt;/a&gt; form the Joint Board of Moderators which assesses and makes recommendations on the accreditation and approval of relevant educational programmes that it will accept as meeting the requirement to register as a professional engineer with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engc.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Engineering Council.)&#160; &#160;&lt;/a&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and Maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Civil Engineer will require a comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of:-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles and techniques used to evaluate the impact of civil engineering infrastructure on society and the environment taking account of business, client and end user needs in its construction, management and use. This includes the importance of the tools used to measure welfare, health, safety and sustainability. Examples include: knowledge and understanding of environmental impact assessment, building information modelling taking into account the context of sustainability, CEEQUAL (a sustainability assessment tool used for the assessment of all types of civil engineering, infrastructure, coastal protection works, coastal landslides, sewerage and drainage systems, and public realm projects and contracts) the environmental impact of materials, integrated transport systems, water quality and supply as well as urban drainage systems for a sustainable built environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The mathematical, scientific and engineering principles, methods and modelling that underpin the design and construction of civil engineering infrastructure. This will include understanding structural and ground responses, properties of materials and their predicted behaviour as part of integrated systems. Examples include, knowledge of the design and construction of buildings, transportation systems, water and wastewater networks, foundations and temporary works, coastal protection, understanding slope stability, retaining walls, ground water movement, elastic/plastic and failure behaviour of materials such as concrete, steel, asphalt and timber, behaviour of structural elements such as beams, land surveying and formulating applicable mathematical solutions through suitable software.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The use and validation of digital solutions and data gathering tools to model, evaluate, design, test, build and manage civil engineering infrastructure, refining as required and applied to integrated solutions. . Examples include: knowledge of software packages including building information modelling, structural engineering design and analysis, computational fluid dynamics and finite element modelling software.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A range of research techniques used to develop innovative solutions to civil engineering problems and the use of current and emerging technologies and products.
