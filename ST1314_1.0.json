  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health and care sector. Biomedical scientists are mainly found working in hospitals, but they may also be found working in other healthcare settings including primary care and in public health. Biomedical scientists may also be employed in industry working in laboratory and research facilities and there maybe opportunity for employment in higher education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council and biomedical scientist is a protected title. Upon successful completion of the apprenticeship, including the HCPC approved degree or the HCPC approved Certificate of Competence delivered by the IBMS, the apprentice will be eligible to apply for registration with the HCPC as a biomedical scientist. Biomedical scientists can apply to be members of a professional body eg the Institute of Biomedical Science.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out a range of laboratory and scientific tests to support the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Biomedical scientists investigate a range of medical conditions, including for example cancer, diabetes, blood disorders (eg anaemia), meningitis and hepatitis. Biomedical scientists perform a key role in screening for hereditary and acquired diseases, identifying those caused by bacteria and viruses and monitoring the effects of medication and other treatments. Biomedical scientists must be able to work with computers, sophisticated automated equipment, microscopes and other hi-tech laboratory equipment and to use a wide range of complex modern techniques in their day-to-day work. Biomedical scientists usually specialise in one of three broad discipline areas. These are infection sciences, blood sciences or cellular sciences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183; patients, service users and carers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183; other healthcare scientists and other members of the healthcare science team, for example laboratory assistants&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183; healthcare professionals, for example allied health professionals, doctors, nurses and healthcare support workers&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183; administration, management and other non-clinical staff, such as porters, cleaners and receptionists&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for using a range of scientific tools, equipment and techniques to carry out a range of tests, investigations and procedures, playing a critical role in supporting the healthcare team in the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Biomedical scientists must work with a high degree of accuracy and must be able to follow standard operating procedures, protocols and policies consistently to ensure the quality of the techniques they use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Biomedical scientists are responsible for the safe use and day to day maintenance of the laboratory tools and equipment they use. Biomedical scientists are required to communicate effectively, in an easy to understand manner, with patients, carers and other healthcare professionals. Biomedical scientists may provide professional leadership in their area of practice. They may supervise the work of others, for example laboratory assistants, and can delegate certain tasks to their wider team under supervision. They are responsible for maintaining their knowledge and skills and must maintain registration with the Health and Care Professions Council. They may contribute to the development of others. Biomedical scientists are able to apply the principles of evidence-based practice to their decision making, using research other sources of evidence to improve the quality of their practice.&lt;/p&gt;",
