There are 12 different AHP professions &lt;strong&gt;(9)&lt;/strong&gt; and you may carry out tasks associated with a single profession or tasks that relate to a range of them. Your supervisor will usually be a registered Allied Health Professional. Illness, disability or a change in life circumstances often means that people have to learn or be supported to do things in new and different ways. This can change the pattern of a life-course but individuals can often expect to regain and enjoy a quality of life through the therapeutic and clinical support you provide. Some individuals may have short term needs eg an injury. Others may have long-term physical and/or mental illness or learning disability that affects their independence, function or way of living. You will be required to work with the individual either on their own or within a group setting. You may also work with others to support the individual eg training carers or working with families.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 130px;&quot;
