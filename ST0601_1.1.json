  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Prosthetist and orthotist&#160;is a registered clinician. This unique occupation provides the opportunity to practice in two areas of healthcare. Most will specialise in Prosthetics or Orthotics; a small number continue in both. &lt;strong&gt;Prosthetists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis and engineering solutions to patients with limb(s) loss. They are trained in mechanics, bio-mechanics, and material science along with anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. They are able to design, provide and modify prostheses that replicate the structural or functional characteristics of a patient’s absent limb(s). They provide care to patients with congenital (from birth) loss as well as loss due to conditions including diabetes, reduced vascularity, infection and trauma. &lt;strong&gt;Orthotists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis and engineering solutions to patients with problems of the neuro, muscular and skeletal systems. They apply mechanics, bio-mechanics, and material science along with anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology when assessing patients. They design and provide orthoses that modify the structural or functional characteristics of a patient’s neuro, muscular and skeletal systems enabling them to mobilise, eliminate gait deviations (improve walking), reduce falls, reduce pain, prevent and facilitate healing of ulcers and prevent physical deformities from progressing. They fit and modify Orthoses, and are accountable and responsible for the impact of any changes. They provide care to patients with a wide range of conditions. Prosthetist and orthotist manage their own patient caseloads, work across all age ranges and with a wide variety of conditions, often providing lifetime care. Whilst autonomous practitioner with leadership and management responsibilities they work as key part of a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) to provide holistic care to patients and work collaboratively with members of the MDT through the provision of rehabilitation and long-term care. Prosthetists and orthotists work for both the NHS and independent companies. Prosthetist and orthotist demonstrate confidence, compassion, competency and effective judgement about risk and be responsible and accountable for their decisions.&#160; Prosthetist and orthotist instruct and guide their technicians in the specification and manufacture of prostheses and orthoses. They also advise them in matters of patient interaction and care when the technicians are dealing directly with patients for example for repairs. They use current evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice with the aim of continually improving outcomes for patients. They are responsible for ensuring their own knowledge and skills are current and support the development of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day to day activities include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide Prosthetist and orthotist &#160;care to patients, most commonly within a hospital environment, working closely with medical staff, physio and occupational therapists&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assess and prescribe tailored orthoses and / or prostheses treatment; working in partnership with patients to tailor treatments to their needs and develop a treatment plan (which may be part of a wider MDT package of care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analyse patient’s needs and involve them in the designand choice of their devise, take measurements (including moulds) and/or use computer modelling to produce a design of the prostheses or orthoses suited to the patient&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide and fit the orthoses and prostheses; educate the patient on how to manage and adjust their device to improve function further&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support patients to maximise their potential over the time of treatment – which could be life long&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out clinical follow-up checks with a patient to see how they are managing with their device and being able to spot ill-fitting, sub-optimal functioning and take appropriate action&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use research, evidence and clinical experience to develop professionally and improve outcomes for patients and the profession (Including participation in clinical audit)&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set selection criteria.
