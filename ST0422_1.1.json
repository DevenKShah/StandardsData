  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Science manufacturing process operatives are employed across the science sector. The sector includes companies working in Nuclear, Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, Formulated Products, Packaging and Polymers. A science manufacturing process operative will undertake basic operations and monitoring of plant and equipment, including pumps, valves, temperature gauges, filtration equipment, tanks, vessels and production/processing machinery; or they will safely operate machines to process/manufacture, assemble and finish component parts or finished products by hand, appropriate to their level of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The working environment may require the use of specialist safety equipment. They may also have to comply with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) regulations if operating in a ‘clean room’ environment. A science manufacturing process operative will be expected to work in a supervised environment either individually or as part of a team. They will be expected to contribute to the maintenance of product quality and be involved in basic process improvement opportunities. They will have an appropriate level of knowledge of health and safety requirements within the industry, basic operating procedures and take a multi skilled approach to achieving production/processing targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Requirements knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Science manufacturing industry plant and equipment, including: pumps, valves, temperature gauges, filtration equipment, tanks, vessels and production/processing machinery such as automated production lines and assembly operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to operate the above plant and equipment, to process/manufacture, assemble and finish industry component parts or finished products and materials in a science manufacturing environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Process manufacturing improvement techniques for example 5S Methodology and Good House Keeping improvements and their application in a science manufacturing environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The organisational structure of their science manufacturing company and their role within it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their organisation’s ethical practices and codes of conduct.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Regulatory compliance and policies typically required by science manufacturing employers, for example external GMP and internal polices required for ‘clean room’ practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The hazards and risks associated with the science manufacturing plant operation and environment and the use of correct personal protective equipment (PPE) and safety equipment to ensure safe plant operation and safety in the workplace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Skills&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare science manufacturing materials, plant and equipment, for hand or machine based process operations, typically using pumps, valves, temperature gauges, filtration equipment, tanks and vessels;

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The occupation is found&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;in science process manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Science process manufacturing is varied. It includes industries such as biotechnology, chemical, composites, petrochemical, polymer, and pharmaceutical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Science process industries combine raw materials and apply a science based process or processes - biological, chemical, or physical - to create products. Products are made continuously or in batches.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Process manufacturing industries are highly regulated. The Health and Safety Executive and other industry regulators inspect employers. The Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations apply to some process manufacturing companies. Employers must manage risks to the employee, product, environment, and sometimes the wider community.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation&lt;/strong&gt; is to complete science-based manufacturing processes to produce materials and products following standard operating procedures. Products are varied and may include battery cells, composite wind turbine parts, drugs, plastic bottles, proteins, and solvents. This involves checking and preparing materials and using specialist science-based manufacturing process plant or equipment. They monitor the process and take action to resolve deviations. Maintaining the work area is part of the role. They contribute to quality control, continuous improvement, and problem solving activities. They also complete work records, which are important in regulated workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In their daily work, they interact&lt;/strong&gt; with other science process manufacturing operatives and technicians, along with colleagues from other business functions. They typically report to a shift manager, team leader, or supervisor.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They are responsible&lt;/strong&gt; for meeting work schedules. They must work to quality, health and safety, and environment regulations and procedures. This may include wearing personal protective equipment and complying with Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They may work alone or as part of a team, under supervision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work in varied conditions. Some workplaces may be physically demanding. Some may require use of specialist safety equipment. They complete shift work. Sites often run 24 x 7, 365-days a year.&lt;/p&gt;",
