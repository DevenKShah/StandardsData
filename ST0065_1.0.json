Additionally, all apprentices must achieve the Level 2 Heating and Ventilating Installer qualification prior to undertaking the end-point synoptic assessment with an independent assessment organisation.

For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Level&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a level 2 Apprenticeship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed in 3 years&lt;/p&gt;",

Installers have a basic knowledge of the systems and how the components within systems relate to each other. They also, under close but not constant supervision: plan allocated work tasks to install system components; undertake allocated work tasks in testing system components; assist in pre-commission testing; undertake allocated work tasks in de-commissioning Installers are able to demonstrate competence in the health and safety, communication, quality control and environmental requirements appropriate to their scope of work. Installers are able to work within new build construction sites and existing buildings under close, but not constant, supervision in the most efficient and economical manner. They must adhere to safe working practices without endangering themselves or others.&lt;/p&gt;",
