  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in creative settings. This ranges from screen production studios, outside locations, entertainment venues and theatres, through to organisations that provide technical solutions for the setup of live, recorded and streamed events. Production technicians work in three main roles; as creative venue technicians, live event technicians or screen lighting technicians. The roles can be venue based or they can be mobile; working across a variety of sites and environments.&#160; Technicians may work across both indoor and outdoor locations. Creative venue technicians play an active role in the technical setup and operation of a variety of established creative venues such as theatres, arts centres, broadcast and film studios. Live event technicians provide technical solutions for live performance and event projects of all sizes across the UK, Europe, and worldwide. The events range from concerts, festivals and theatrical performances through to exhibitions, conferences, product launches, and showcases. Screen lighting technicians provide the lighting and power solutions for film and TV both on location or in studios to enable screen production requirements to be met.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to prepare, build, set up, and operate functioning systems for creative productions; including screen, theatre, live performance and events. These systems can include sound, lighting, power or video. Technicians read, interpret and give appropriate technical information to colleagues and clients. They use a variety of tools to assemble, install and maintain technical and production systems.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship with three options:&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 1: Creative venue technician - also known as CVT&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A CVT provides technical support for the construction, rehearsal, presentation and removal of a live performance. They are multi-skilled across a wide range of technical disciplines. They possess a broad level of knowledge relevant to the venue in which they operate. CVTs will be competent in lighting, audio, video and stage systems related to live performance. They apply these competencies to their resident premises and production. They are skilled in stagecraft techniques such as operating stage machinery and performing scene changes. This allows them to set up, rig, operate, maintain and carry out basic repairs of technical equipment used in creative venues.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 2: Live event technician -&#160;&#160;also known as LET&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;LETs set-up technical equipment for live events and usually specialise in sound, lighting or video. They have knowledge of the equipment used in different environments and will have the ability to calibrate systems. They specify components to deliver high quality outputs across a range of different settings. LETs are responsible for the control, servicing, repair and storage of complex technical equipment. Their specialist knowledge enables them to troubleshoot and repair components and systems at sub assembly level.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 3: Screen lighting technician - also known as SLT&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SLTs set-up technical lighting and power equipment systems for film and television productions.&#160; They have knowledge of the equipment used in different environments and will have the ability to set up and de-rig lighting packages either on location or in a studio setup. They will be able to understand the lighting plan and install lighting fixtures to deliver the desired effect across a range of different settings. SLTs are responsible for the control, setup, de-rig and storage of complex technical equipment. Their specialist knowledge enables them to troubleshoot lighting and power solutions on set or on location.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, technicians interact with a wide range of partners and collaborators. This may include art departments, camera operators, sound technicians, production team, performers, directors and producers. They may also interact with presenters, audiences, and members of the general public. Although technicians are required to work independently and may be required to support junior colleagues, they usually operate under the direction and supervision of a supervisor or manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All technicians will be proactive in finding solutions to problems and identifying areas for improving processes, ensuring work is accurate and of high quality. In any context working safely and efficiently is paramount. Technicians may be required to work at height.&#160; Many projects are carried out in fast-moving, dynamic workplaces. Technicians may be required to work flexible working hours, weekends and evenings.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
