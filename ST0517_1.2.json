  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists work across a range of settings, including health, social care, education and other private and voluntary sector organisations. They work with individuals of all ages, including those with physical and mental health conditions, injuries, learning disabilities and palliative care needs, as well as those who are displaced or marginalised from their communities. Occupational therapists also work with families, carers, employers and organisations that support the individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An occupational therapist’s primary goal is to enable individuals to participate in occupations in a meaningful way. In a therapeutic context, the term ‘occupation’ refers to everyday activities that people want, need, or are expected to carry out. Using a holistic person-centred approach, informed by evidence-based practice, occupational therapists support service users to carry out everyday occupations, such as dressing, eating, catching the bus to work, or other activities that are important to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists work as autonomous, accountable practitioners, individually or within a team. Through assessment, intervention, critical reflection and applying analytical skills, they reach collaborative solutions to service users’ needs. &#160;Occupational therapists are responsible for reflecting on the effectiveness of their actions and ensuring their knowledge and skills are current, with the aim of continually improving the service they provide.&#160; They demonstrate leadership and management qualities, and are required, within the professional and regulatory standards, to contribute to the development of the profession by supporting student therapists and supervising those in other roles.&lt;/p&gt;",
