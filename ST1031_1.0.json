Multi-channel marketers will sit within a specific company/agency that provides marketing deliverables and advice to external clients, or within an internal marketing team, delivering marketing activities to drive that business. The role will be primarily office-based or remote working. They may spend time away from the work area attending exhibitions and events, meetings with external marketing suppliers, marketing research suppliers, visiting clients, trade shows, or supporting research activities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to support customer focussed marketing activities that drive the demand for a product or service through awareness raising and/or perception building to generate results to the bottom line. The emerging green economy is creating increasing opportunities for new and complex services and products. This may require marketing activities to be focussed on raising awareness of the benefits of carrying out transactions or purchases or products within an environmentally sustainable model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the Marketing team the multi-channel marketers will contribute to the implementation of the Marketing strategy and plans. They will be responsible for delivering day-to-day marketing activities across a multitude of platforms, channels and systems that are essential to the Marketing function and activities of the company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of internal stakeholders such as members of their own team, other departments such as sales, operations, public relations, IT, HR, customer services, senior management and finance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also interact with external stakeholders such as clients/customers and suppliers such as printers, digital agencies, PR and media agencies, event display companies, market research agencies, and media sales professionals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for coordinating and delivering specific marketing activities such as marketing content creation, background market and customer research, monitoring campaign analytic and collecting data, using relevant marketing software/systems, maintaining marketing administration activities such as managing the supply of marketing literature, tracking marketing expenditure, supporting the procurement of, and overseeing the delivery of work by external and internal marketing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Multi-channel marketers will define, design, build and implement campaigns across a variety of platforms to drive customer engagement and retention. In addition, they will be responsible for parts of the campaign within their area of responsibility. As part of the Marketing team, they will contribute to the implementation of the Marketing strategy and plans and will have responsibility for elements of the overall marketing plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will be the first point of contact for day-to-day activities in the marketing team and will be responsible for allocating higher levels of work to the management team. This role will work on their own and in a range of team settings. They work within agreed budgets and available resources. Multi-channel marketers work without high levels of supervision, usually reporting to senior stakeholders. They may occasionally be responsible for decision making on smaller areas of campaigns, but more often will support or influence the decisions of others.&lt;/p&gt;",
