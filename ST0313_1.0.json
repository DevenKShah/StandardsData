In the public sector a commercial professional’s role is to support the transformation of the way that the best quality public services are delivered, whilst securing value for taxpayers’money. Experience will be gained working on high-profile, high-value, high-risk projects that affect millions of people and are worth billions of pounds each year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The work of commercial professionals in the public sector includes the process of procurement, or buying goods and services; however, a commercial role is much broader than just procurement. This role extends to a huge range of related commercial activity such as influencing commercial policy, financial analysis, engaging in contract law, and developing strategy to deliver public services. In the public sector the variety of goods and services that commercial professionals are responsible for is vast: goods could range from buying a tank or submarine for the military, to negotiating new trains on behalf of Transport for London. Securing services could include: finding new and innovative IT systems, outsourcing translation services for a local magistrate court or closing a deal on a construction project for a new school or prison.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A good commercial professional will support their organisation in sourcing and negotiating the best deals on goods and services. To fulfil this role an individual must develop skills and knowledge across all three aspects of the commercial lifecycle: pre-procurement, sourcing and contract management. Responsibilities in pre-procurement may include analysis of suppliers in the market and consideration of the best strategy to deliver the good or service. The sourcing process involves securing a contractual agreement with a supplier who is to provide the good or service. Finally, a contract management role comprises of day-to-day management of existing contracts; ultimately ensuring the good or service is being delivered to an acceptable standard. Achieving Level 4 in Public Sector Commercial will enable an individual to use their breadth and depth of experience to position themselves as a fully effective commercially skilled professional with career options that span from public to private and charity sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Following tables explain the skills, knowledge and behaviours required from a successful apprentice on completion of the programme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 88px;&quot; width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 414px;&quot; width=&quot;414&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Level 4 Commercial Professional Must be Able to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Know and Understand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context of Procurement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;414&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The commercial life-cycle: pre-procurement, sourcing and contract management, and be aware of how these stages fit into the organisation’s structure.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The difference between private and public sector procurement.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-procurement &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and Early Market &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engagement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;414&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The market, supplier and service landscape before beginning the tendering process, e.g. understand the effect of market competition and concentration.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Different commercial and contractual models e.g. use of SMEs, mutuals and joint ventures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Commercial and sustainability risks and opportunities associated with sourcing decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;88&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sourcing and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Agreements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;414&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How business needs are captured and shape commercial decisions; be aware of how such business objectives are articulated in contractual agreement and procurement specifications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How public money is managed and spent, including the host organisation’s own rules on setting and managing budgets.
