An installer/servicer will be able to work on a range of powered doors such as sliding, swing, folding, balanced and revolving.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The work is carried out in a variety of applications supporting business activities in a wide variety of sectors. Providing barrier free building access supports businesses in meeting the requirements of the equality act, building security, providing user comfort and contributing to meeting environmental obligations. Generally powered pedestrian doors are found in buildings, for example offices, residential property, hospitals, transport interchanges, banks, education facilities and supermarkets however, they are also common in cruise ships and large portable trailers such as medical screening trailers. Installations can take place on new building sites, during refurbishment of buildings and in end user occupied buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Key activities are: the installation, routine maintenance, fault finding and repair, commissioning and de- commissioning of powered pedestrian doorsets. They have a thorough understanding of the engineering principles and safe operation of powered pedestrian doorsets. They work without immediate supervision, and liaise effectively with other trades and with end users.&#160; The safety of themselves, work colleagues and ensuring that powered pedestrian doors used by the general public and employees are efficient and safe to use is a key responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The more widespread application of powered pedestrian doors, combined with evolving safety legislation and technology means that the requirements for skilled people in this sector are constantly growing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The core skills and knowledge can be transferred to other applications such as the industrial door, manual door, gate and security sectors where drive controls and safety systems are used.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Requirements: Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours –&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Underpinning principles&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Sound understanding of Drive systems, electricity, sensors, switching technology, machinery safety and risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Legislation, Regulations and Standards&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of relevant UK and international standards, technical and environmental legislation including health &amp;amp; safety, environmental protection and working with electrical circuits.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of industry Codes of Practice and other sources of up to date information and advice on technical safety and legislative aspects of their work: BS EN 16005:2012, BS7036 1996 Parts 1-5, BS7036-0 2014.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Data analysis&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to understand assembly diagrams and architectural drawings, calculations for door speeds and energy levels, force gauges, charts, door settings and tables.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;System fundamentals&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Understanding of the function and operation of door system components and how they interact in a range of different systems and applications.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Control circuit application&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Electrical wiring and control systems setting, testing and fault finding; and their integration with motors, control boards and safety sensors applicable to powered pedestrian doors.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;94&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mechanical operations&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Measuring building openings and correctly positioning and fixing the door components and automatic drive unit.
