An installer/servicer will be able to work on a range of powered doors such as sliding, swing, folding, balanced and revolving.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The work is carried out in a variety of applications supporting business activities in a wide variety of sectors. Providing barrier free building access supports businesses in meeting the requirements of the equality act, building security, providing user comfort and contributing to meeting environmental obligations. Generally powered pedestrian doors are found in buildings, for example offices, residential property, hospitals, transport interchanges, banks, education facilities and supermarkets however, they are also common in cruise ships and large portable trailers such as medical screening trailers. Installations can take place on new building sites, during refurbishment of buildings and in end user occupied buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key activities are: the installation, routine maintenance, fault finding and repair, commissioning and de- commissioning of powered pedestrian doorsets. They have a thorough understanding of the engineering principles and safe operation of powered pedestrian doorsets.
