  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a number of sectors including those such as food production, chemical production, construction and retail. The need for sustainable business is becoming ever more important throughout the UK and globally.&#160; Organisations are now reflecting this in the decisions they make and the policies they put in place.&#160; To achieve these goals, Sustainability Business Specialists help companies, public services and non-profit organisations to identify and implement policies to manage the resources used and the waste generated by the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help the business to find new and innovative approaches to working and build resilience based on economically sound, socially friendly and environmentally driven principles. They will be responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring business sustainability strategies; communicating plans; formulating budgets; and marketing sustainability strategies to customers, suppliers, colleagues and consumers. The role is highly challenging and multifaceted and will reach across all areas of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with numerous colleagues including a specialist subject manager or a senior manager within the organisation at executive or non-executive director level or within smaller organisations they may be at director or board level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation may lead a team or work in a matrix management structure to drive change.&#160; They would be required to liaise with external stakeholders on a variety of sustainable issues, for example Non Government Organisations (NGOs), industry and regulatory bodies. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for implementing a sustainability culture throughout the business. This will mean they will need to work across functions throughout the organisation and will have a high level of autonomy to do so. In some companies, they may lead a small team of dedicated experts, however in a number of other organisations, they will work within a management structure with no line management responsibilities. The level of supervision they receive will be down to the size of the company and the individual structures of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;",
