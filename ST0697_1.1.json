In their daily work, health visitors and school nurses will interact with: Teachers, schools, children, parents, carers, General Practitioners, Social Workers, maternity and other health professionals and may work with the police and other legal staff where there are safeguarding concerns.&#160; They will also interact with the children’s workforce in the local authority services, voluntary organisations, adult mental health, early years settings and a range of private and public sector services associated with children and young people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Occupational health nurses provide services across a wide range of environments and in any workplace/institution (e.g. construction sites, NHS).&#160; They are involved in protecting health at work through risk management programmes, providing expert advice, and promoting health and wellbeing within the workforce in line with health and safety legislation and the public health agenda. In their daily work, occupational health nurses will interact with: Company employees, managers, human resource staff, health and safety and other professional advisers, trade unions and legal staff, site visitors, General Practitioners, other health professionals and Governing Bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Specialist Community Public Health Nurses are responsible for their own work as an autonomous, independent practitioner, whilst leading and contributing to collaborative working with other health and care professionals.
