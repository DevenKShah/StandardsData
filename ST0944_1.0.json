  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in broadcasters and production companies that edit and produce music and sound content prior to release across multiple platforms. This includes music that is recorded for sale under the artists name and that used in TV, radio, film and computer games.&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Recording Technicians work as part of a small team, in a studio environment. They work with a variety of technological tools. They need knowledge and skills related to both the hardware and software used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work closely with, and under the direction of more experienced and senior Audio or Recording Engineers. Audio recording businesses may be large or small. Assistant Recording Technicians may work directly for a studio or in a self-employed capacity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to produce a high-quality recording. They work on the technical aspect of recording. This requires balancing and adjusting sound sources using equalization and audio effects, mixing, reproduction and reinforcement of sound. This usually starts with a &quot;sound brief&quot; which outlines what is required. Their job is to check that this is delivered, engaging with artists and clients. This can include the placing of microphones, pre-amp settings, the setting of levels, the specification and set up of equipment. They monitor the quality of the recording in relation to the equipment setup and use this information to make adjustments. They adapt their approach to suit the artist and to achieve the final sound required. They record how the equipment was set up, so it can be replicated if required. They also store the final audio files in a suitable format, and which protects the security of the data. An Assistant Recording Technician resolves hardware and software problems and monitors the use of software. They engage with the artist and/or client to ensure that their needs are met. The physical recording of any project is done by an audio engineer. It is a creative profession where musical instruments and technology are used. Assistant Recording Technicians assist with the recording of master files and ensure that audio files are stored securely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with creative representatives from client organisations and other members of the technical staff engaged with the recording process. Assistant Recording Technicians also engage with client organisations and representatives from suppliers, and work as part of a team. They work with artists and others with diverse skills sets. They need to work with people with different characteristics and know how to manage potential conflicts of opinion and approach. An employee in this occupation must ensure that technology is used effectively and correctly to achieve the sound that producers and artists are seeking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Recording Technicians have a significant impact on the final sound experience. They balance technical and creative skills to produce the impact that the director and other creative staff members and clients/artists want to achieve. Assistant Recording Technicians trouble shoot processes and technical issues and provide solutions to resolve them or work with colleagues with relevant experience. Sound recordings may of great interest to members of the public prior to their completion. They must ensure that physical and digital assets are stored securely and safely and ensure that files are not subject to piracy or theft. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many instances, Assistant Recording Technicians will work under the direction of senior audio/recording engineers. The assistant will work with them on more complex sound projects, responding to the guidance and experience of the senior staff. These individuals will act as mentors to the assistant recording technicians and ultimately enable them to take on increasing levels of complexity and responsibility. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring that technology is used effectively and correctly to achieve the sound that producers and artists are seeking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assistant Recording Technicians have a significant impact on the final sound experience. They balance technical and creative skills to produce the impact that the director and other creative staff members and clients/artists are seeking to achieve. Assistant Recording Technicians trouble shoot processes and technical issues and provide solutions to resolve them or work with colleagues with relevant experience.&lt;/p&gt;",
