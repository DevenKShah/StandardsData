  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Water network technicians work in the water industry.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers in the industry range from small to large but are mainly large.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and option apprenticeship. Apprentices will be trained and assessed against the core and one option (occupation). There are three options:&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option1.\u202FWater distribution network technician&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 2.\u202FWater leakage technician&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 3.\u202FWastewater network technician&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Water industry network technicians work outdoors on water or wastewater networks and may go to customer premises. They also spend time in the office.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They may be required to drive between locations. Typically, a driving licence is required.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work in all weather conditions.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As 24 hour and seven days per week operations, they may need to undertake standby duties and work shifts outside normal working hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupations is&#160;to ensure continuity and efficiency of water&#160;or wastewater&#160;industry network services.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, they interact with operatives and other technicians. Plus stakeholders from teams across water or wastewater services, or within the wider business. This may include scientific teams, process treatment, engineering, maintenance, call centre, network optimisation, and contractors. They engage with customers and members of the public. They may also interact with internal and external stakeholders. This may include representatives from the Environmental Agency, police, highways, and other external regulators.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They typically report to operational or network managers. They work with minimal supervision. They may work as part of a team and alone.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are responsible for meeting quality, industry regulations, safety, security, and environmental requirements. They ensure the health and safety of self and others. They need to consider how their work has the potential to impact customer service and the company&#39;s finances and reputation.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Water distribution network technicians carry out planned and unplanned valving operations. They undertake customer visits to resolve water quality enquiries, which may include taking water quality samples and giving advice on water quality. They undertake and provide advice to customers on water fittings. They must take account of Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Water leakage technicians use systems to identify potential and actual leakage and undertake activities or identify action required to reduce leakage.\u202FThey assist in the repair and maintenance of meters and loggers. They will provide advice to customers on pipework ownership and responsibilities pertaining to leakage.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Water distribution network technicians and water leakage technicians must have a National Water Hygiene (Blue) card. This involves training and assessment, and health screening.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wastewater technicians respond to incidents and monitor wastewater networks resolving issues or identifying action required. They carry out or supervise system maintenance activities such as high-pressure water jetting&#160;and&#160;de-silting operations. They undertake surveys for example CCTV camera work or Sonde tracing equipment to assist with fault diagnosis.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wastewater&#160;network&#160;technicians must take account of Environmental Quality Standards&#160;relating to planned and unplanned discharges.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
