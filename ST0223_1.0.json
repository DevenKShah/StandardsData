As from Wednesday 1st July 2020, all apprentices entering EPA, must have completed an Ofqual regulated, Level 3 Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) one day course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard is at Level 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3 years from the date of implementation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
