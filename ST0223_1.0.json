However it came to light that this was unclear and some apprentices have undertaken non Ofqual regulated Emergency First Aid at Work qualifications which comply with Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1998. In order that apprentices are not disadvantaged who hold these qualifications, the employers have agreed that they can enter end-point assessment (providing all other requirements have been met) up until Tuesday 30th June 2020. As from Wednesday 1st July 2020, all apprentices entering EPA, must have completed an Ofqual regulated, Level 3 Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) one day course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard is at Level 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3 years from the date of implementation&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
