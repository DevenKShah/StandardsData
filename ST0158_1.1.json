Dual Fuel Smart Meter Installers are responsible for the safe installation, exchange, commission, decommission and ongoing maintenance of Smart metering systems and associated equipment and communication systems. &#160;This includes the explanation of how these work and giving up to date energy efficiency advice to the customer. The role is physical in nature, and may involve lifting and moving of equipment, working at heights and working in confined spaces.&#160; This occupation entails carrying out a high level of safety critical activities whilst working in customer properties. Therefore there is a rigorous requirement for a disciplined, responsible and professional approach to work that provides customer service excellence at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprenticeship and will include a recognised background check, equivalent to Criminal Record Bureau/Disclosure and Barring Service (CRB/DBS). The apprenticeship is demanding and employers will typically look for applicants who have gained a minimum of 2-4 GCSEs at grade C (including mathematics and English), or equivalent qualifications/experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Current Health, Safety and Environmental legislation and regulations applicable to work in the gas and power industries&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gas and electrical testing and assessment procedures needed to establish the condition of the equipment and installation and the actions needed as a result&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gas and electrical theories and procedures involved in the practical application of installation, exchange, commission, decommission and maintenance of Smart metering systems and associated equipment and communication systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant electrical/mechanical principles and how they are applied in work processes and procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Up to date knowledge of energy efficiency principles to be able to provide advice and guidance to the customer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of Smart metering systems to be able to discuss and advise the custome&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Current regulatory compliance, the recognition of different customer needs including vulnerability as defined by Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) and Smart Installation Codes of Practice (SMICoP)company rules, policies and procedures as defined by the employer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out a thorough and rigorous risk assessment to ensure safety of customer, self and property on arrival, during install and upon exit&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take personal responsibility for maintaining safety standards and achieving job objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use tools, equipment and personal protective equipment in a safe and appropriate manner&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install, exchange, commission, decommission and ongoing maintenance of Smart metering systems, associated equipment and communication systems in accordance with industry standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with focus and clear purpose in all conditions and locations, covering business requirements, usually working alone and safely adapt working methods to reflect changes in working environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on customer premises/property showing appropriate care, respect whilst focusing on safety&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a variety of appropriate communication methods to interact with customers and others to give/receive information accurately, in a timely and positive manner in order to deliver the best possible experience to customers.
