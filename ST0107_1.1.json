Systems Engineers integrate multiple technological elements in complex systems that, in the case of socio-technical systems, may also include organisational elements and human interactions. &#160;Socio-technical systems include requirements that span hardware, software, personnel, and community aspects (e.g. a rail network includes human considerations at many different levels).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with project managers or personnel from business development and/or sales functions. They may assemble and manage teams of domain specialists (such as mechanical, electrical, electronics, software engineers, etc.) and subject matter experts in specific technology or scientific areas. A Systems Engineer will often work in a customer-facing role ensuring that the system meets customer and user needs and preferences, often with responsibility for technical and business communication. &#160;Mostly the occupation is office-based, although site visits may be needed during implementation of designed systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for overall technical management and coordination within a programme or project and contribute to safety, security and quality of outputs.&#160; They may be responsible for specific processes within the lifecycle as, for example, a Requirements Engineer, Systems Architect, or Integration Engineer.&#160; For larger programmes or projects, Systems Engineers will typically be responsible for staff and budgets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jobs typically held by individuals undertaking this occupation include Lead Engineer, Project Engineer, Technical Lead, Acquisition Engineer; Systems Engineer; Test Engineer; Requirements Engineer; Requirements Manager, Systems Architect, Systems Designer, Systems Analyst, Engineering Manager, Systems Specialist, Technical Manager, in-service Engineer, Through-life Systems Engineer, Operation and Support Engineer, Acceptance Engineer, Integration Engineer, Interface Manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Duties:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and manage the system lifecycle for a project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and manage project requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage project risk&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model and analyse systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate solution concepts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Architect and design systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and manage systems integration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and execute system verification&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and execute system validation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide technical leadership within a project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support transition of the system into the operational environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide systems-level in-service support of the system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support technical aspects of project management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for configuration and data management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Co-ordinate technical outputs and work of multi-disciplinary teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge, skills, behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To carry out the duties of a systems engineer, the following knowledge is required:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;K1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles. The occupation is found in any sector where complex engineered systems are defined, developed and/or operated; some examples are transport (e.g. rail, aviation, automotive, maritime), defence &amp;amp; security, telecommunications, health, manufacturing, construction, and infrastructure. Systems Engineers are found in all parts of the supply chain from Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to multi-national businesses, and in commercial and public sector organisations. The broad purpose of Systems Engineering is to create and execute an interdisciplinary process to ensure that the customer and stakeholder&#39;s needs are satisfied in a high quality, trustworthy, cost efficient and schedule compliant manner throughout a system&#39;s entire life cycle. Systems Engineers integrate multiple technological elements in complex systems that, in the case of socio-technical systems, may also include organisational elements and human interactions. Socio-technical systems include requirements that span hardware, software, personnel, and community aspects (e.g. a rail network includes human considerations at many different levels).

An employee in this occupation will be responsible for overall technical management and coordination within a programme or project and contribute to safety, security and quality of outputs. They may be responsible for specific processes within the lifecycle as, for example, a Requirements Engineer, Systems Architect, or Integration Engineer. For larger programmes or projects, Systems Engineers will typically be responsible for staff and budgets. Jobs typically held by individuals undertaking this occupation include Lead Engineer, Project Engineer, Technical Lead, Acquisition Engineer; Systems Engineer; Test Engineer; Requirements Engineer; Requirements Manager, Systems Architect, Systems Designer, Systems Analyst, Engineering Manager, Systems Specialist, Technical Manager, in-service Engineer, Through-life Systems Engineer, Operation and Support Engineer, Acceptance Engineer, Integration Engineer, Interface Manager.&lt;/p&gt;",
