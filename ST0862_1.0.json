They will carry out risk and needs assessments and undertake safety planning with survivors of domestic abuse and or sexual violence, and work within a multi-agency framework to ensure the safety of adult and child survivors of domestic abuse and or sexual violence, is prioritised. This may include supporting on a one-to-one or group level with survivors and perpetrators, updating and collating information from a range of service providers, updating own knowledge regarding legal, health, housing, finances and safety requirements related to domestic and sexual violence and abuse, recording case work and progressing case work through the application of knowledge and skills. There are many different job titles used for occupations in the domestic and sexual violence sector and it would be impossible to include all, especially as there are different job titles for those that carry out the same roles in different organisations. However, there are clear distinctions made between those that support adults, those that support children and those that only support victims of sexual violence. The options offered in this standard reflect this and enables all apprentices to gain an apprenticeship for their given job role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
