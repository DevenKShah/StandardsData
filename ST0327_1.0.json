  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of a retailer is to assist customers when they purchase products and services, which requires a good understanding of the stock being sold, the variety of ways customers can shop and the ability to process payments, for example, using a till. Retailers must be passionate about delivering a quality service that always aims to exceed customers’ expectations. Therefore, retailers enjoy direct contact with a wide range of people and are motivated by completing a sale and knowing a customer is happy with their purchase. They can work in a variety of shops and other retail establishments: small boutiques, large high street chains, supermarkets and well-known department stores are just some examples. More specialist retailers include funeral services, garden centres, delicatessens and people who work in remote environments for example in telephone, on-line and mail order retail. Regardless of the type of products and services being sold, a wide representation of employers from across the retail industry have defined this standard and agreed that the knowledge, skills and behaviours that apprentices must have to do their job are the same.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td

width=&quot;149&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Know how to identify and determine individuals’ situation and needs and how to respond in the most appropriate way in line with the business culture (for example the difference in how a branded goods retailer would communicate to their customers would be very different from an individual that retails a funeral service, or someone that needs to convey highly technical product information)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Use effective methods of communication that achieve the desired result, according to the

seasonal product / service knowledge, and stock requirements at different times of the year&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Use a variety of sales techniques

on the technical specification of a product and the aftercare service may be necessary)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;270&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Help match products and services to
