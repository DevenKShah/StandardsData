They will be competent in the design, manufacture and assembly of the components required in a pipe organ; in putting organ pipes onto speech and tuning them; and in the repair, maintenance and tuning of existing organs. They will be using materials such as wood, leather, tin and lead, and will be primarily working either in a workshop or on site (typically a church or public auditorium).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Links to professional registration&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful candidates will be recognised by the Institute of British Organ Building (I.B.O.) as qualified organ builders, eligible for employment by any of its accredited business members.
