  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in any company or industry involved in manufacturing. Some example sectors include food, aerospace, fast moving consumer goods and automotive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide technology leadership in the digital transformation within the organisation&#39;s manufacturing functions. The occupation requires a deep understanding of manufacturing operations, digital operational technologies and information technology, together with the leadership capabilities to be able to pull together these diverse competences into a coherent business strategy and be able to manage the implementation of projects. The digital manufacturing engineering leader will have an appreciation and understanding of people, processes, and technology aspects of the digital transformation within manufacturing. They will have the ability to evaluate both emerging and mature technologies to apply them within their own manufacturing setting and manage the associated business change as being critical to this role. They will ensure environmental targets and sustainability requirements are incorporated into transformation programmes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of internal and external stakeholders such as management, engineers, senior leaders, manufacturing staff, project managers and customers. They will typically be based in a variety of locations such as in an office but can also spend time within the manufacturing environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring digital manufacturing transformation is planned and completed in line with considerations such as efficiency, health and safety and sustainability requirements. The digital engineering manufacturing leader will lead people, technology programs, business process development and governance across the organisation and will have a great deal of autonomy. They may typically manage other people, which may vary based upon the size of the organisation but could include technical engineers, project managers and external contractors This role can report into operations or engineering and technology functions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
