  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the social housing, local authority and police sectors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to investigate reports of anti-social behaviour (ASB) &amp;amp; community safety issues, to deliver informal and formal resolutions to the issues, to explore prevention &amp;amp; diversionary solutions, to work effectively with partner &amp;amp; enforcement agencies, to support victims &amp;amp; witnesses, and where appropriate, vulnerable perpetrators. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with residents and tenants, community groups, partner agencies including social care, police, health &amp;amp; education, and the legal sector including solicitors and barristers. The employee usually works as part of a team and will be supervised by a manager or team leader. The employee will also need to interact with multiple internal departments. The occupation is part office-based but requires a lot of interaction with residents in the community and some attendance at multi agency meetings as well as attendance at court. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for investigating reports of ASB / Community Safety in an area. This includes the categories of hate incidents, threats, assault, abusive behaviour, noise complaints, gang related activity, criminality, substance misuse, public disorder, animal nuisance and any behaviour that causes nuisance, alarm or distress to members of the community. The reports can be between neighbours, or they can affect a particular community, or can be city / town centre issues. The employee will interview those affected as well as the alleged perpetrators. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The employee is responsible for exploring preventative, early intervention or supportive solutions to the issues such as mediation, restorative justice, warnings, acceptable behaviour contracts, an agreed care plan. If the behaviour continues despite informal solutions the employee will be responsible for gathering evidence and preparing the case for legal action such as injunctions, closure orders or possession. When gathering evidence, the employee will prepare witness statements and, in some cases, will employ and analyse technology such as CCTV, noise monitoring equipment, and specialist noise apps. In some areas, the employee will present cases to court when the matter is heard in the Judge’s chambers. The employee will work with other partner agencies with a view to resolving the issues e.g. if there is a mental illness or a substance abuse issue involved, the employee will liaise with health organisations to explore support options. The employee will be supervised by a manager and is usually part of a specialist team. The size of the team will vary according to the areas the organisation covers. This role is a specialist one and the employee is required to have a number of technical skills and behaviours to engage with the range of people they interact with, particularly victims, witnesses &amp;amp; perpetrators. The occupation relies on the employee having a working knowledge of the legislation available which can be used in ASB / Community safety cases as well as knowledge of procedures relating to dealing with ASB / Community safety reports, investigative processes, evidence , victim &amp;amp; witness support , risk assessments, engaging perpetrators, responsibility and roles of partner agencies. The employee may also respond to domestic abuse reports so needs the skills and knowledge to respond appropriately, offer correct advice, risk assess and refer to appropriate agencies. The employee is also required to follow an organisation’s policies and procedures in relation to the role as well as have knowledge of an organisation’s legal obligations, safeguarding, equality &amp;amp; diversity, data protection policies &amp;amp; procedures. The employee is required to take responsibility and be accountable for managing their caseload appropriately, and within set KPIs. In this role, the employee needs to be risk aware at all times and understand vulnerability. The employee is required to have a flexible approach and be able to respond to urgent or high risk cases as necessary. Their performance will be monitored by a Manager / Supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;",
