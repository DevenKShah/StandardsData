  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Physician associates are healthcare professionals who work alongside registered doctors and provide medical care as an integral part of a wider healthcare team. They are &lt;em&gt;dependent&lt;/em&gt; practitioners, which means that they must work with a dedicated medical supervisor, but are able to work autonomously with appropriate support. They can be found working in GP surgeries, accident and emergency departments, care homes and hospitals. Physician associates are medically trained to provide all aspects of health care to patients, including: consultation, assessment, treatment and management of their health care. They can take medical histories, perform physical examinations, request and interpret investigations, diagnose and manage patients, and perform an extensive range of specialised procedural skills within their scope of practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Physician associates ability to practise medicine is enabled by collaboration and supportive working relationships with their medical supervisors, meaning that there is always a registered doctor who can discuss cases, give advice and attend to patients if necessary. In this way, physician associates increase the numbers of the medical workforce and increase access to quality care for patients. They act in an enabling role, helping to reduce the healthcare team’s workload, and bring new talent to the NHS, adding to the skill mix within the teams. Physician associates may work in specialist fields of medicine but always maintain their generalist knowledge and skills. They offer continuity and stability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duties of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Physician Associate (PA) can:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;take medical histories from patients&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;perform evidence based physical examinations on patients, for example listening to a patient’s heart and lungs, i.e. heart and lung auscultation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;make clinical decisions based on patient centred assessments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;determine the direction of patient management and care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;formulate, implement and critically evaluate a patient management plan&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;perform specialised diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, for example perform and interpret an electrocardiogram (ECG)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;request and interpret specialised diagnostic studies for patients, for example requesting blood tests and interpreting the results&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;build and sustain the clinician-patient relationship&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;provide health promotion and disease prevention advice to patients&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;develop and mentor other health care professionals (including other PAs in training)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;produce records of clinical decision making and actions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;adhere to information governance requirements&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Job titles:&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;Physician associate&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will be required to complete a Diploma or MSc in Physician Associate Studies.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completing the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Registration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices are required to register with the Managed Voluntary Register (PAMVR) which is held by the Faculty of Physician Associates and anticipated to transfer into the agreed statutory register.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 30 – 36 months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;after 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Values and Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will be caring, compassionate, honest, conscientious and committed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will value people as individuals, and respect equality and diversity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will recognise the importance of people’s rights in accordance with legislation, policies and procedures, and where necessary, provide appropriate challenge.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours and probity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consistently behave with integrity and sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Behave as an ambassador for the role, acting professionally and behaving considerately towards other professionals and patients.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Recognise and work within the limits of your professional competence and scope of practice, and within the scope of practice of your supervising medical practitioner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain effective relationships with colleagues from other health and social care professions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inform patients, carers and others of the nature of your clinical role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the effectiveness of a clinical learning environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain confidentiality at all times&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;93&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;152&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;170&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;93&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Patient centred history taking and physical examination&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;152&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.1&#160;&#160;
