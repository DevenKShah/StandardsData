  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Fall Protection Technician is an occupation found in mulitple environments and sectors. Locations can be urban or rural, within buildings or outdoors. It is a highly technican role involving autonomous working and supervisory responsibilities to undertake safety critical work typically in small teams of 2-4 persons installing products designed to keep others (maintenance, industrial commercial and cleaning staff and access specialists) safe from injury due to fall hazards in the future. As well as working in teams, technicians are required to work alone and be solely accountable for the work they carry out.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work an employee interacts with construction sites managers, building managers and a wide range of clients. They will typically report to a Contracts Manager or the technical design team. As technicians are responsible for installing height safety equipment designed to provide lifesaving protection to other, they will need to have technical knowledge of the basic engineering principles behind the products they install and a wide range of practical expertise in the application and interaction this equipment and building structures. They will be able to read and interpret engineering drawings, designs and product documentation to effectively plan and organize their own work, taking responsibility for their own acts and omissions to their level of competency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fall protection sector is made up of 150-200 companies ranging from small regional operations to major manufacturers. It operates across all sectors, energy, infrastructure, commercial, industrial, entertainment, retail and agricultural. Fall protection equipment is found numerous public and private buildings across the UK, in addition to commercial and industrial applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
