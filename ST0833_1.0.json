  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the ordnance, munitions and explosives (OME) sector in small, medium and large organisations in the public and private sectors. These include the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, defence contractors (research and manufacture), the security services, mining and quarrying companies, the film industry (special effects) and pyrotechnics manufacturers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to be involved in or contribute to the design and operation of OME by preparing explosives compositions and devices. They may also undertake explosives test and evaluation activities to ensure the fitness for purpose. In doing so they must work in a safe and environmentally sound manner, potentially within a hazardous environment, following approved safe systems of work. For example, they may work with pyrotechnics in the film industry, explosives engineering in the construction / mining sectors, explosives / munitions in the armed forces, research and manufacture in the defence sector or putting on a complex public fireworks display..In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate team and supervisors/managers; internal and external contractors and supply chains; there will also, on occasions, be interaction with multi-disciplinary teams including personnel from other commercial organisations in the OME sector, government agencies such as the police and security services and armed forces, regulatory bodies and/or members of the public. Interacting with internal and external stakeholders such as gathering data and information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very likely that an OME technician will work in secure premises in urban or rural areas, which could restrict their movements during the working day. As this is a safety critical occupation there may be restrictions on personal activities, such as the use of personal electronic devices in the working environment or being able to eat / drink outside of a formal break or rest period and they must demonstrate a high degree of professionalism and self-discipline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some roles will require the individual to work outdoors for much of their working time. OME technicians could work solely in the UK or their role might require them to travel abroad, potentially to hazardous environments. Depending on the employerâ€™s business, they may also be required to work flexibly and outside of normal hours.. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for reporting to the OME Team Leader, they will undertake the required routine tasks according the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). These tasks may require planning and prioritising personal and team activities to meet safety and operational needs. Due to the nature and level of responsibility it is not anticipated that the role would have any budgetary responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will be responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Complying with legislative stipulations and organisational health, safety, environmental policy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Contribute to activities to prevent fire and explosions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Preparing and setting up an OME processing area and equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;OME inventory activities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Undertaking inspection of OME to determine serviceability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Preparing OME for processing and storage tasks in line with instructions and operating procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Undertaking routine disposals of OME via the approved waste routes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Participating in the improvement of the OME lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Participating in the inspection and maintenance of OME facilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Providing appropriate technical advice and guidance including knowledge sharing or coaching and mentoring.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Undertaking activities to ensure free from explosives (FFE) certification.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Undertaking the safe and controlled shut down of OME processes for planned and unplanned situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Participating in the generation, review or evaluation of OME standard operating procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
