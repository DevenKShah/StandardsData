  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;independent company servicing of a range of watch brands or a workshop maintained by a particular brand of watch. The independent company may be:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;a small business such as a jeweller. In this setting, the watchmaker would service watches for their customers,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;alternatively, the watchmaker may be employed by a large company focusing on servicing watches directly for the public and for other businesses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;to service quartz and mechanical watches (manual winding and automatic winding watches). The watchmaker will also complete part jobs whereby they replace components which are worn or damaged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The work is skilled, precise, and delicate in nature and requires the use of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;test equipment to assess the functioning of the watch and determine faults,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;hand tools to dismantle, reassemble and adjust the watch,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;machine tools for cleaning watch components and case refurbishment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An understanding of the principles involved in the functioning of both quartz and mechanical watch movements is important together with a background knowledge of timekeeping, history, and the watch industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;their employer, managers, other watchmakers, and team members. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The watchmaker may also interact with clients or customers and suppliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for t&lt;/span&gt;he maintenance of their hand tools and the use of test equipment and machinery in accordance with relevant Health and Safety legislation. They are responsible for working ethically and disposing of waste materials and cleaning fluids in a sustainable manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The watchmaker may progress to servicing more complex watches such as chronographs, and to restore watches for private individuals and the heritage sector. They may also manufacture watches.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
