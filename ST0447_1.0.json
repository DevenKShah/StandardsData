  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The clock maker is found in the Heritage and museum, manufacturing, retail and repair, public and Industrial sectors. A clock maker is someone who is able to use their skill and labour to service, repair and manufacture components for a range of clocks as well as being able to manufacture a complete clock. The work is skilled and precise in nature and requires the use of hand and machine tools as well as an understanding of horological theory and history. As most of the work undertaken by clock makers is the repair and restoration of clock mechanisms, it is important that a good understanding of the topics below is grasped.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A clock maker should be able to manufacture or specify for manufacture all the components within a clock.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A clock maker may find themselves working in a small team for another clock maker, or as part of a jewellery business. Individuals could eventually, with further training, go on to become self-employed, servicing clocks for others and the general public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work an employee would interact with members of the public, other clock makers who are manufacturing specified components, suppliers, managers/employer, and other team members when working in a manufacturing or retail environment. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for basic maintenance of tools and understanding of the appropriate level of Health and Safety legislation. The employee would expected to be able to service and recognise faults within standard striking platform and pendulum clocks with minimal supervision, however for more complex work they may seek further guidance. It is expected that the employee will have an awareness of restoration, conservation practices and ethical practice.&lt;/p&gt;",
