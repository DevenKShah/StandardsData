  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the furniture and interiors industry. Furniture finishers prepare and treat wood and manufactured boards, for example MDF and veneered boards to give it a smooth finish and bring out its natural beauty. Items to be finished could range from tables, chairs, lounge suites, cabinets, chests of drawers, bespoke furniture, kitchen units and shop fittings. They may also work on fitted items such as staircases, wall panels and doors and on musical instruments like pianos. With antique furniture and some specially commissioned modern pieces, polishing and finishing are carried out by hand. Building up layers of polish is a slow and methodical process. With modern manufacturing and mass-produced items, furniture finishers also use a pressure spray-painting method. Furniture finishers may also be involved in carrying out simple repairs. Employers vary in size from micro to large. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to finish furniture by applying modern and traditional finishing products. Furniture finishers analyse and agree requirements and prepare hand crafted or production furniture for finishing. They identify and apply different types of finishes creating decorative effects or specialist finishes on furniture such as French polishing. They operate machinery and carry out routine maintenance. They also solve routine problems and issues and contribute to continuous improvement activities. Furniture finishers can work in a range of environments from small workshops to large factories and may be required to work various shift patterns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with furniture manufacturers, designers, production or manufacturing managers, quality technicians, cabinet makers and joiners, production leaders and product developers. In smaller organisations they may also interact with customers. They usually report to a supervisor or shift team leader. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for preparing and treating a wide range of timbers and man-made boards, using a range of techniques. They are responsible for the quality of their own work and meeting production targets. All work must be completed in line with health, safety and environmental regulations and considerations. They must wear personal protective equipment such as goggles, masks and protective clothing.&lt;/p&gt;",
