  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Hospitality managers work across a huge variety of organisations including bars, restaurants, caf&#233;s, conference centres, banqueting venues, hotels and contract caterers. These managers generally specialise in a particular area, however their core knowledge, skills and behaviours are aligned. Common to all managers in this role is their passion for exceeding customers’ expectations. Hospitality managers have a high level of responsibility and are accountable for fulfilling the business vision and objectives which requires excellent business, people and customer relation skills. Individuals in this role are highly motivated team leaders that combine a talent for management and specific industry skills and thrive on the customer facing nature of the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Description of specialist management functions&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Food and Beverage&amp;nbsp;manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Food and Beverage managers manage the delivery of business standards in a range of settings including bars, restaurants, caf&#233;s, conference centres, banqueting venues, hotels and contract caterers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;House&amp;nbsp;keeping manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Housekeeping managers manage the delivery of business standards for the presentation of establishments such as hotels and other overnight accommodation including hostels, serviced apartments and conference venues, making sure that they are clean, fresh and tidy in public areas and guest accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Front office&amp;nbsp;manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Front office managers manage the delivery of the business standards for the reception function and, where relevant the nights’ team and porters, reservations for example in hotels and conference venues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue managers devise and implement strategies that aim to optimise revenue across the business, for example rooms, conference and events and food and beverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conference and&amp;nbsp;events manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Conference and events managers manage the delivery of functions often simultaneously such as business conferences, conventions, banquets or weddings. The role requires managing meticulous coordination liaising with multiple departments across the business to meet a variety of different customer needs and expectations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hospitality outlet&amp;nbsp;manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hospitality outlet managers manage the operations of a hospitality retail outlet, such as quick service restaurants, branded coffee or sandwich shops. The role is often in a fast paced environment with the focus on meeting customers’ expectations of efficiency and consistency for both the products and service they receive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kitchen manager (head chef)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kitchen Managers / Head chefs take responsibility for the delivery of consistent levels of food preparation, cooking and service, typically in high volume and often fast paced or complex production catering kitchens. High levels of financial accountability, adherence to strict procurement, stock management and food safety requirements provide a challenging environment which needs to be managed with a considerable amount of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Multi-functional manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In some organisations a hospitality manager covers a range of different operational functions, applying their skills, knowledge and behaviours in different contexts, and not necessarily addressing one function in full. Multi-functional managers have substantial accountability and responsibility for meeting clear management objectives with their team and must balance priorities across each of the functions they are given responsibility for. For example a manager may be required to oversee the restaurant service and be responsible for bar, banqueting and conferences on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;
