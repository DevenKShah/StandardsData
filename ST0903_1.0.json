  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the British and International visual effects (VFX) industries, providing digital content for film, television, advertising, corporate and immersive reality industries. VFX companies and studios vary in size and the number of employees they have, and are described as small, medium or large companies. They are to be found across England and the UK. The output and remit of a VFX studio is varied, and they will produce work for a range of clients across advertising, film, television and immersive reality. Some studios specialise in one area, particularly feature films which is the largest area of the industry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VFX is the term used to describe any imagery created, altered, or enhanced for moving media. This involves the integration of live-action footage and computer generated (CG) imagery to create images, which look realistic but would be dangerous, costly, or simply impossible to capture during live-action shooting such as explosions, car crashes or flooding of cities. The broad purpose of the occupation is to select and use relevant 3D software to create visually engaging motion graphics, animations or images (assets). This sometimes involves working with two- or three-dimensional models. The animations and graphics they create are stylistically consistent and enhance the visual style of their work. In some cases, a sequence might be entirely computer generated with no live action background elements.&lt;br /&gt;The Junior VFX Artist (Generalist) needs a thorough understanding of 3D camera principles such as lenses, distortion and parallax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Junior VFX Artist (Generalist) work out the co-ordinates and the movement of the physical camera and/or objects in a live action shot; they must be able to track cameras and objects quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;The Junior VFX Artist (Generalist) need to be able to deliver work within established project targets and timelines, and to the high-quality standards of their company and clients. They may also support and advise other artists with their tracking tasks. They may also be required to work on visualising complex scenes in a 3D animation (pre-viz, the 3D equivalent of a storyboard) before moving on to the more detailed parts of the process. The motion files/assets created (camera, object or body track) need to be integrated into the VFX workflow pipeline and within the organisational requirements for organising, storing and retrieving assets. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with engineers, designers and team leads, other visual effects teams, their supervisor and/or the client. This is a junior level role, and the line management and reporting structure of the team will vary according to the size of the employer. They must be able to take direction and feedback, in order to create the effects required, according to the story being created, the VFX/CG Supervisor and the Director&#39;s wishes. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• managing their own workload with the VFX production team and/or their lead, generating the required work on time, to meet the brief of the supervisor/client, &lt;br /&gt;• attending dailies/review sessions in order to gain feedback on their work and respond appropriately to that feedback, &lt;br /&gt;• working within the particular workflow pipeline/toolset of the company that they are working for&lt;br /&gt;• working effectively in collaboration with clients, colleagues, partners and suppliers in the VFX industry to ensure that the CG elements are seamlessly incorporated into the shot&lt;br /&gt;• using innovative approaches to solve problems and ensure VFX assets are delivered in line with production requirements &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Junior VFX Artist (Generalist) should understand their place within the production workflow process and the importance of this and being able to organise their VFX outputs using appropriate storage processes and systems; it is usually a studio based role.&lt;/p&gt;",
