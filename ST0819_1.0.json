  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Construction. The broad purpose of the occupation is to prepare and deliver a high standard of work relating to the removal or repair of asbestos containing materials from both the built environment and contamination of the external environment, which originated from within the built environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exposure to asbestos currently results in 5000 deaths per year. Asbestos Removal Operatives perform an essential role in removing, or making safe, asbestos containing materials to reduce the exposure of people to asbestos, thereby safeguarding the public by reducing the incidence of asbestos related diseases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Employers carrying out the highest risk work on asbestos must be licensed by the Health and Safety Executive. The work must be carried out in a way which prevents or minimises asbestos exposure and other relevant health and safety risks. Therefore, appropriate controls must be in place to ensure exemplary health and safety management. When these controls are in place and all proper processes are adhered to, the work can be carried out safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asbestos Removal Operatives are required to construct work areas for asbestos removal / repair to take place, safely remove or repair asbestos containing materials, package and remove asbestos waste material and decontaminate plant and premises to ensure the work area is suitable for normal reoccupation following the work. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their site team in the main. The site team usually comprises of a site supervisor and a team of asbestos removal operatives, of which the employee would be one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The occupation is normally carried out in buildings constructed or refurbished prior to the year 2000. The buildings can be occupied or derelict, awaiting demolition or refurbishment. In addition asbestos containing materials which have been used in the built environment can have spread to the external environment, such as brownfield sites which have previously had structures containing asbestos located on them, or sites where illegal disposal of asbestos waste has taken place. Therefore the occupation can be carried out either indoors or outdoors, and in all kinds of weather conditions. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for carrying out the asbestos removal / repair in accordance with the site specific plan of work, standard company procedures and under the direction of the site supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;",
