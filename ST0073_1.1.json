Additionally, and depending on their role within the organisation, a Payroll Administrator may also have responsibility for the accurate and timely completion of routine and non-routine payroll-related calculations and other information.&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The main duties may typically include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gathering, creation and processing of payroll-related information to ensure employees are paid on time and accurately. This will be via payroll software, though it’s use must be accompanied by the ability to perform this manually &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Compliance with legislative and contractual obligations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Internal and external reporting of payroll information to deadlines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Effective and appropriate communication with employees and relevant stakeholders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working to relevant ethical and professional standards in a legislative and regulatory environment that is constantly changing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Competence within the payroll occupation is demonstrated in this Standard by the required Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours detailed below. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apprentices without Level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking End Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3.&#160; British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Professional Registration and Progression:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whilst studying this apprenticeship, an Administrator will be eligible for immediate professional body recognition at Student Affiliate level of the Global Payroll Association (GPA).&#160; Also, professional body recognition as a student member at the Chartered Institute of Payroll Professionals (CIPP).&#160; Successful completion of the apprenticeship will provide eligibility to apply for Individual Affiliate membership of the GPA and Associate membership of the CIPP.&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Completion of the Payroll Administrator Apprenticeship may provide progression opportunities to more senior positions such as Team Leader, Supervisor or Manager within Payroll, or to move to related roles in departments such as HR, Finance or Pensions.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On completion of the Apprenticeship, a competent Payroll Administrator will meet the following requirements:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;

width=&quot;84%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The payroll function is different depending on&#160;the sector in which the organisation is operating. &#160;To create, process, validate and report payroll-related information, it is essential to know the environment in which the organisation exists.&#160; For example, is the role in the private or public sector, is it a bureau-type operation, internal function etc. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand and appreciate that this awareness information is crucial to recognising customer and supplier needs and obligations, both internal and external&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td rowspan=&quot;3&quot;

This requires a wide overview of many different activities that will or may be encountered.&#160; For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The legislative framework surrounding payroll, employment and pensions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Devolution in the UK&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The different types of workers in the UK&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The different types of pay that exist (gross, taxable, National Insurance applicable etc), statutory payments and deductions, Court Orders and the Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Real Time Information (RTI)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Benefits-in-Kind&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gender Pay Gap Reporting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gain familiarity, knowledge and an understanding of these core elements&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;9%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Payroll and Pension professions are intrinsically linked.&#160; Achieve an overview of the pension landscape as it affects payroll, for example the different types of schemes, the UK systems of tax relief and the relevance of the State Pension.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Further, a broad understanding and appreciation of the structure of workplace pensions / Auto-Enrolment is fundamental.&#160; This includes the key rules, roles and administration responsibilities as per guidance produced by The Pensions Regulator&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;9%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;To ensure the organisation meets its payroll-related statutory and contractual obligations, understand the technical aspects of payroll for the accurate calculation of gross through to net pay.&#160;

width=&quot;84%&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Payroll is governed by regulation and compliance standards which must be applied in the workplace. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Payroll Administrator will understand how to apply the regulatory, compliance and legislative environment for the technical payroll aspects above.&#160;

A working knowledge of these is fundamental to an administrator’s ability to perform their role at the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Payroll Administrator will be proficient in the systems and processes that are applicable in their role, including at least one piece of computerised payroll software and spreadsheet package, such as Microsoft Excel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations delivering in-house payroll or in a payroll bureau, bookkeeping or accounting practice providing payroll as a service. The payroll administrator may sit within another business function, for example HR or Finance or may be a stand-alone role. The role may exist in the private, public or voluntary sector for businesses of varying sizes. The role delivers a customer service to employers, clients and those they employ, so both business and customer awareness are essential.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to process the payroll for an organisation. The payroll administrator may carry out payroll tasks for their employer or on behalf of another organisation. Payroll tasks must be carried out in compliance with statutory regulations, contractual obligations and internal controls. Payroll processing tasks will be carried out using software, but a payroll administrator must also be able to perform these calculations manually. Payroll is not a regulated profession and there is no need for any professional body membership to undertake the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, a payroll administrator carries out processing and changes that will result in the calculation of net pay.&#160; This also includes changes as a result of life events.&#160; The role requires interaction with internal and external stakeholders. These may include HR and Finance teams, clients and Government departments such as HMRC and The Pensions Regulator. A payroll administrator may work within a team, often reporting to a team leader or a manager. They may have sole admin responsibilities, for example when working in a bookkeeping practice. The work is often highly pressured to deliver accurate outputs to tight timescales such as weekly or monthly payroll outputs. To deliver a high-quality service under pressure, collaboration with colleagues and an ability to prioritise and be flexible is vital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A payroll administrator will handle payroll queries and complaints from employees and other stakeholders. They may also be responsible for the accurate and timely completion of routine and non-routine payroll-related calculations and other information. Payroll is a constantly changing landscape so payroll administrators must keep up to date with key changes affecting payroll. This can include changes to legislation, guidance, or payroll software&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
