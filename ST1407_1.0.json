Most candidates will have achieved grade C or above in English and Maths and a STEM-related subject at Level 2 prior to commencement of apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English and Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice will have a depth and breadth of english and mathematics that allow them to operate successfully within their role. This may be met through entry criteria determined by the employer or qualifications and training within the apprenticeship. However, on completion all apprentices will have minimum level 2 qualifications in english and mathematics. Some employers may mandate training or qualifications at level 3 in english and/or mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard aligns to the core engineering skills required for similar occupations in other industries. This Standard has been designed to deliver sufficient Underpinning Knowledge and Understanding (UKU) and allow apprentices sufficient experiential, work based learning opportunities to satisfy the requirements for Professional Registration as Engineering Technician (EngTech) as defined by the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will compile an Apprenticeship training plan that describes the training their apprentice will need to meet the standard. It may include a mixture of external and internal training that will ensure the apprentice is fully competent by the end of their programme and ready to take the assessment. It will show when each area of the standard must be acquired and assessed and which areas may be acquired off the job. An apprentice will receive a minimum of 20% of their training away from their day-to-day job. The apprentice will gain transferable core skills and knowledge. In addition they will gain skills specific to the job role and the working practices of their place of employment. The requirements of the apprenticeship are designed to offer stretch and progression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship standard will be reviewed by employers in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Process industry technicians are found in process manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They run processes involving high hazard inputs to produce products that meet specifications. This may include chemical-based products, stabilised crude, ethane, butane, methane, and hydrogen. The working environment is highly controlled due to the use of high hazard chemicals. Technicians must follow high-level safety systems. Typically, production is on a large scale using a continuous process. This usually means operations are 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Technicians may be required to work shifts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians run and maintain the process or processes in line with operational parameters. They conduct quality assurance, resolving or escalating any issues, and complete records. Maintaining workplace safety by following health, safety and environmental risk and management systems is a vital part of the role. Preparing equipment for maintenance and bringing equipment back on line is also part of the role. They also support risk assessment, improvement activities, and audits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis, they work with other members of the process team. They also have contact with people in other teams for example, laboratory, maintenance, process engineering, supply chain, and warehouse. They may also have contact with external people such as, customers, service providers, and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must ensure that the process and products meet quality specifications and are produced to schedule. They must work to external manufacturing regulations to protect the process, product, plant and equipment, company employees, and the environment. They must also consider sustainability. They may need to wear specialist PPE to protect the product or themselves. This may include, safety glasses, chemical resistant gloves, suits, and footwear, and breathing apparatus. They may work alone or part of a team. They work with minimal supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of their work.&lt;/p&gt;",
