  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the transport sector. Passenger transport operatives work in the wide variety of settings that enable customers to travel on the public transport network. They work at stations or on-board trains, trams, buses and coaches.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers are mainly larger private sector organisations operating time-tabled services, though some are run by the public sector. Employers range from those providing busy national services, through to smaller-scale local services that connect communities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help customers travel to their destinations. Passenger transport operatives do this by helping customers travel safely, on time and in comfort from the beginning to the end of their chosen journey. Passenger transport operatives work within safety-critical environments. They provide high quality services to customers, ensuring that safety, customer care, and commercial standards are met. They assist other staff and identify customer needs, particularly during a disruption in service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passenger transport operatives can expect to work in all weathers, per their shift rosters (including weekends). They may be required to work a mixture of day, evening and night work depending on the transport services provided. Some may operate the same routes each day, though this will vary a lot depending on their responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with customers a great deal of the time. Passenger transport operatives also interact with members of their team and other colleagues who work together to provide an efficient service, for instance, drivers. Passenger transport operatives interact with their manager, who is also likely to be a transport professional. They also interact with key external stakeholders when needed, such as emergency services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing their work in line with their roster and allocated duties. This typically includes providing an accurate and effective customer information service that engages and improves satisfaction. And they may also be required to help passengers to board and disembark. Depending on their role, they will be responsible for selling tickets/products, helping travel services to leave on time, or providing&amp;nbsp; an onboard support service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passenger transport operatives are responsible for ensuring their safety and that of others at all times, reporting all accidents and incidents at the first available opportunity. They work closely with other service delivery colleagues to provide exceptional customer experience to make it easy for customers to travel, especially during times of disruption, emergencies or incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passenger transport is highly regulated; passenger transport operatives need to be aware of both the expected standards and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship takes a core and options approach. All apprentices must attain the core knowledge, skills and behaviours. Apprentices must also select one from either the ticketing, dispatch or onboard options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those who work in ticketing usually offer a full counter service at the station or depot. This can be quite pressurised, depending on the number of passengers. They offer specialist assistance with travel across the UK network. They must diagnose a customer situation and offer impartial advice on the appropriate travel solution, which can mean selling tickets beyond their own organisations network. They may also be required to promote certain services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some passenger transport operatives instead work on board vehicles. They may be required to check tickets, and in some situations also sell a limited range of tickets. Their main responsibility is to keep the travel environment safe for all who use it. They must monitor and respond to live events, from passenger issues to delays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, dispatch operatives work on the platform. They receive, turn around and dispatch vehicles in line with set procedures. They also have to monitor and respond to activity happening within the station or platform, such as overcrowding. They have the power to stop a vehicle when required to maintain safety. These three occupations work together in teams to provide a seamless service that allows fare paying passengers to safely access their chosen transport to their destination.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
