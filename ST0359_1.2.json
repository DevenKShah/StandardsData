Qualifying as a Scaffolder provides opportunities to work in many different sectors including Construction, Infrastructure, Nuclear, Oil and Gas, Rail, and Events across the UK and internationally. The primary role of a Scaffolder is to provide access solutions or structural support which allows other trades to carry out their roles safely whilst working at height. Upon completion of this apprenticeship, the operative will have achieved the established trade competency for the scaffolding industry which will enable them to erect, alter and dismantle a wide range of scaffolding structures as covered by this training and assessment. Scaffolding is a safety critical trade and each individual working in the sector must be aware of their responsibility to themselves, those they are working with, the end user of the scaffold and also others who they may come into contact with whilst carrying other their role e.g. other trades, clients, members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;546&quot; style=&quot;width: 546px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;546&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion the Scaffolder will have the following core knowledge:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The relevant British and European Standards, NASC guidance e.g. TG20, SG4, SG6 and statutory regulations applicable to the correct and safe erection and dismantling of scaffolds and where to find additional information e.g. NASC website, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) website&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The types, uses and methods of inspection, and the purpose of various scaffold materials e.g. tubes, boards and fittings in common use.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The methods of handling, stacking, and servicing scaffold materials e.g. tubes, boards and fittings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The types, uses and purpose of prefabricated beams, and the rules for their assembly and connection to scaffold structures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The purpose, types, uses and loadings of protection fans.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Construction and the Built Environment Industry.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers range from small, medium businesses to large enterprises. Projects vary in size, scale, and duration, and could include domestic refurbishments, new built housing, large scale industrial, commercial properties and challenging locations, like bridges, powerlines, towers and offshore. Scaffolders work outdoors in changeable weather, indoors or both depending on the project.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide access solutions or structural support which allows other trades to carry out their roles safely whilst working at height.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scaffolders construct, alter and dismantle scaffolding structures using a variety of scaffolding equipment, tools and methods. They build secure and stable temporary structures where scaffold working platforms can be installed to create a safe working environment for other workers. With sustainable construction at the forefront of all projects, it is expected that scaffolders do so by also giving consideration to the environment and sustainability of materials, waste awareness and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scaffolders are working in accordance with customers’ specifications following design drawings, compliance sheets and manufacturers’ specification when installing, altering or dismantling scaffolding structures.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of the public, clients, site managers, and other trades such as roofers, slaters &amp;amp; tilers, groundworkers, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers, decorators etc. Scaffolding is a safety critical trade and each individual working in the sector has a responsibility to themselves, their working environment, and others who they may encounter whilst carrying out their role.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, using equipment, materials and tools to erect, adapt and dismantle scaffolding structures according to designs or manufacturers&#39; specification.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scaffolders are also responsible for ordering materials, tools, and equipment. They work to industry recognised safe systems of work, health safety and environmental guidance and legislation including the HSAWA, Work at Height, COSHH, RIDDOR, PPE regulations and other relevant industry guidance.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
