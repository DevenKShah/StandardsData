  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in arboricultural, utility, facilities management and grounds maintenance organisations. These include local authorities, arboricultural consultancies, estates, commercial organisations and charities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to undertake tree inspections and surveys, recording information on tree management databases and to evaluate each tree individually. Although evaluating a tree requires balancing a wide range of factors and is complex and varied by nature, Arboriculturists focus on well-defined and more commonly found situations. The Arboriculturist would be supported when dealing, for example, with ancient or veteran trees, those that are rare, those that are of historical or cultural importance or those involved in subsidence.&amp;nbsp; They supervise contractors undertaking specified tree works and can check for the safety of the site and quality of work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arboriculturists comply with legislation in relation to trees including making sure relevant authorities have approved work to be undertaken. They provide tree related advice – management and law. They manage woodland, having oversight of budgets, make grant applications and preparing quotes. They manage clients and engage with the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues, the general public, stakeholders, clients, landowners, lawyers, insurers, budget holders and organisations managing built infrastructure (for example utility companies, highways, street lighting, waterways, railways).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Assessing tree health and risk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Managing contractors&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dealing with complaints&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Understanding and applying law relating to trees&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Planning and prioritising survey requirements to ensure work delivery and discharge of legal Duty of Care and to prepare and assess planning applications&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Complying with legislation and regulation regarding trees, woodlands and forests to include tree preservation orders, conservation zones, felling licenses and other designations.&lt;/p&gt;",
