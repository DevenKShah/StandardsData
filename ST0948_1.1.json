  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a range of healthcare settings offering different models of care. Most midwives are employed by the NHS while others work in the private sector, social enterprise or independently. A midwife may work in the community such as in a woman’s home, community hubs, GP surgeries, clinics, midwife-led units and birth centres or in hospital maternity units. This means that they usually work shifts including evenings, weekends and nights and may be on-call to provide 24-hour care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to be the first and main contact for a woman, her partner and family. Recognised as a responsible and accountable professional, the midwife acts as an advocate for the woman, working in partnership with her and giving the necessary support, care and advice during pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period. Midwives are lead co-ordinators of care as well as the first point of contact for a woman, her baby and family. They offer support, care and advice and are responsible for facilitating births and providing care for the newborn. Midwives are experts in normal physiological birth and in supporting the woman through all birth outcomes. The personalised care they provide includes preventative measures, the detection of complications in mother and baby, the promotion of normal birth, the accessing of medical care or other appropriate assistance and the carrying out of emergency measures. The midwife has an important role in public health, offering health counselling, prevention and education, not only for the woman, but also within the family and the community. This work involves antenatal education and preparation for parenthood and may extend to a woman’s health, sexual or reproductive health. A midwife provides full antenatal care for the woman, carrying out clinical examinations and screening. They offer antenatal and parenting classes to help the woman, her partner and family prepare for labour, the birth of the baby and how to care for the baby once born. The midwife monitors and supports the woman, her partner and family during labour and birth, helping the woman to birth her baby and assessing both the woman’s and the baby’s overall health and wellbeing. Midwives can identify complex pregnancies and know when to refer to others or seek appropriate support. They are able to offer information guidance and support around issues such as stillbirth, miscarriage, termination, neonatal death or other complications. Following birth midwives offer support for infant feeding and postnatal care and may refer the woman to other services as required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with women and families from a range of backgrounds. Midwives need to have excellent communication skills to support the woman, her partner and family through the emotional, physical and psychological process of childbirth. Midwives are part of the wider health and social care inter-disciplinary, multi-disciplinary and inter-agency team, working in partnership with colleagues as required. A midwife must have excellent situational awareness and knowledge of other human factors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing care during pregnancy, labour and the postnatal period.&#160; A midwife will care for a number of women and provide continuity of care and carer. Midwives are responsible and accountable autonomous practitioners who provide woman and family centred integrated care. Midwives are advocates for women, enabling them and their families to make informed choices about the options and services available throughout pregnancy, labour and post-natal period. The midwife is responsible for the health of both the mother and baby and refers to others if there are medical, social, safeguarding issues or other complications. Midwives are regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and are responsible for their own practice and for keeping up to date with current knowledge and skills.&lt;/p&gt;",
