  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering and manufacturing sector within the marine industry. Marine electricians may work for boat manufacturers, refit and repair boatyards, marinas and specialist marine electrical and marine electronic companies. These can be small, medium or large businesses within the marine leisure, small commercial, and superyacht sectors. These sectors employ over 33,000 people. Marine electricians can undertake work on a variety of boats including for example motorised cruisers, narrowboats, sailing boats, work boats, and superyachts. The broad purpose of the occupation is to conduct a wide range of marine electrical, and marine electronic work operations that include the design and installation of marine assemblies and sub-assemblies. Upgrades, diagnostics, and maintenance to existing marine electrical and electronic systems and marine electrical and electronic repairs on boats, ensuring the safe and optimal use of a boat’s electrical and electronic systems and services, that meet customers’ requirements.They are responsible for installing, maintaining, monitoring, fault finding and repairing a wide range of marine electrical and electronic systems. They are responsible for undertaking the work from inception through to completion, including commissioning the electrical work, testing it and supporting sea trials. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other marine electricians, line managers and a wide range of associated marine trades such as boat builders, marine engineers, stock control staff, and project managers. They also interact with customers, suppliers, other technical staff, and regulatory and industry bodies (e.g. Lloyds Register, Maritime Coastguard Agency, Royal Institution of Naval Architects, and Institute of Marine Engineering Science and Technology).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine electricians’ work operations can be undertaken on boats in a workshop environment, or on boats moored or stored outside on hard standing near water, or in the water and they may also attend sea trials. Marine electricians need to work safely and may work in confined spaces, on or near water, aloft, or at height. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing their work to agreed timelines and in accordance with work instructions and relevant legislation, regulations, codes of practice and other relevant guidance and information. Marine electricians are responsible for designing and producing solutions to boat layouts and requirements, and producing marine electrical and electronic systems from electrical, engineering and technical drawings and specifications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine electricians are responsible for performing a range of calculations, using formulae and electrical measuring equipment and galvanic bonding and cathodic protection. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine electricians are required to maintain effective lines of communication and solve problems relating to the marine electrical and electronic work requirements. They are required to discuss and understand customers’ electrical and electronic requirements and are responsible for undertaking diagnostic and problem solving to identify faults and make repairs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They need to understand navigation systems, radar, radio and communications, helm control systems, alarm and monitoring systems, boat communication systems and interface protocols, including alternating current (ac) and direct currents (dc) distribution and loadings and power generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marine electricians must comply with Health and Safety and the Electrical Safety at Work Acts including the control of substances hazardous to health (COSHH), the waste electrical and electronic equipment regulations (WEEE), and work at height and work on or near water requirements. They need to understand the dynamics of water and electrical systems and components to ensure the safety of themselves, the boat users and the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;",
