  "entryRequirements": "&lt;p&gt;There are no specific entry requirements. However, vet tech candidates are likely to have some husbandry skills and livestock knowledge and may have worked in a vet practice at a more junior level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Vet Tech may be required to work unsociable hours and will be required to visit clients. Individual employers will determine their own entry requirements; but due to the nature of the role requiring periods of physical exertion, safe travel to and within ports, it is expected that candidates will meet certain medical standards of physical health and it is highly likely they will hold a full standard driving licence.&lt;/p&gt;",

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in large animal livestock veterinary businesses. Veterinary Technicians (Vet Techs) typically undertake work on behalf of the practice on their clients’ premises, which are predominantly commercial Farms and smallholdings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The veterinary practice can range in size from large multi-site operations to small independent employers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vet Tech’s work in line with relevant standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out common husbandry and technical tasks that are generally in the interest of promoting the health and welfare of livestock or in the breeding of livestock. This may include vaccinations, mobility assessment, foot trimming, disbudding, and growth monitoring. Other tasks may be preparing livestock for procedures such as surgery or embryo transfer and assisting veterinary surgeons who are undertaking procedures, recording data, and handling semen or embryos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Vet Tech aids the Veterinary Surgeon (vet) to monitor and improve the health and welfare of livestock through preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They help to deliver health plans and protocols to prevent health issues and diseases. They deliver treatment following a diagnosis carried out by a Veterinary Surgeon, and when agreed treatment protocols are in place.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Vet Tech will typically collect data on incidences of certain health conditions. This will help when setting health and disease control plans, including livestock health and welfare checks in line with vet practice protocols. They work independently on client’s premises and carry out dynamic risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also conduct environmental assessments to find out areas that could be contributing to health and welfare issues. This could include housing, comfort/ ventilation, and walkways that could cause lameness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Vet Tech will not give advice or carry out treatment unless on an agreed protocol set out by the vet. Whilst on the farm, the Vet Tech can, with the agreement of the client, take non-intrusive samples to check for problems. Samples will be collected and either analysed in practice or sent off for further investigation to enable diagnosis of any condition. Any treatment would be discussed with the vet and a protocol set out for the livestock. The Vet Tech would be responsible for using the correct sample collection procedure and communicating information to the client’s vet. The Vet Tech may support the Vet in practice in collecting blood samples.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Vet Tech often views onsite livestock conditions more regularly than the vet and they need to regularly communicate health and welfare matters to both the client and the vet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Vet Tech will report directly to a vet. In their daily work, they will also interact with practice administrative staff, other Vet Techs, vets, clients (farmers, enterprise managers, smallholders), and other agricultural professionals e.g. Nutritionists, Consultants, Animal and Horticulture Advisory Board (AHDB) staff. They may also be required to support and guide vet and agricultural students so will need to be able to work independently and as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Livestock health and financial pressures can be stressful for clients. Vet Techs also observe the welfare of clients and report any concerns to the vet or vet practice vet responsible for the client/livestock so that help and support can be arranged. It is important that the Vet Tech maintains professional working relations as they will be responsible for full client confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for scheduling their own workload and complying with vet practice protocols. They will be responsible for operating good biosecurity and maintaining equipment.&lt;/p&gt;",
