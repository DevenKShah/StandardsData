The range of available qualifications also provides routes into specific areas of the business. &amp;nbsp;This could include careers in Investment Analysis, Management and Administration roles; Risk Controller, Manager or Modeller; &amp;nbsp;dealing and/or advising in Securities, Derivatives or Packaged Products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 4 apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years or when significant change is required&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
