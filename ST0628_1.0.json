  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Conservators are specialist practitioners working to protect, preserve and conserve objects or collections of objects housed in archives, art galleries, libraries, museums, private collections, as well as historic and ancient sites. They may also undertake work related to the internal and external features of buildings, such as historic decorative interiors, stained glass windows and sculpture Conservators combine practical skills with knowledge of art history, architecture, science, changing fashions and lifestyles to understand the context of the objects they work with, and to conserve them sensitively and appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are two principal branches of the profession, however many conservators will work across both. In any case, they will have knowledge of both aspects in their practice even if they do focus on one area.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Conservation,&lt;/strong&gt; also known as remedial or interventive conservation, relates to the conservator carrying out treatments directly on objects. As a matter of principle, the remedial conservator aims to carry out as little work as possible or necessary to avoid changing the object. In such cases the conservator will aim to leave the object stable and re-treatable. Treatment conservators will often specialise in working with a particular type of object or material, such as paper, stone or wooden objects.&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Conservation&lt;/strong&gt; aims to prevent damage to objects in use or storage. Its purpose is to maintain the condition of an object as well as to manage deterioration risks resulting from handling or adverse environmental conditions. Practically this can include a broad range of tasks including the installation of environmental monitoring equipment and associated data monitoring, pest management, consultation on the design of new galleries and exhibition spaces, storage, and setting standards for the loan of objects.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Conservators may work for public institutions, such as national and regional museums or galleries, archives and libraries, or in historic properties either as an employee or freelance, as well as for conservation practices in the private sector. Conservators may also run their own practice.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Environment: &lt;/strong&gt;Depending on area of specialism time, may be split between working in a conservation studio or on site. There may be occasional call for long periods away from home, for instance those working on immoveable objects or accompanying objects travelling to an exhibition. &lt;strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Duties / Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Duties will vary depending on the employer, but are likely to include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undertaking conservation measures, either through physical treatments to objects or implementation of preventive conservation measures based on a good working and background knowledge of area of practice. Conservators are expected to use their own judgement although some treatments may be complex and non-routine, requiring consultation with experienced conservators to analyse and plan their implementation.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Designing, implementing and reviewing Integrated Pest Management and Environmental Monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Assessment and management of risk to collections on display, in storage, and undergoing interventive treatment and identification of strategies to mitigate against these risks.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Organisation of collections in storage / on display and the maintenance of appropriate records using collections management systems and related databases.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Planning, commissioning and managing conservation work.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Overall responsibility for the long-term care of collections within area of practice.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job titles include:&lt;/strong&gt; Conservator, Specialist Conservator (e.g. Preventive, Paper, Paintings, Metals, Stone, Photographic, Digital Preservation, Time-based media].&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;thead&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 90px;&quot; width=&quot;90&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORK ASPECTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 138px;&quot; width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKILL &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 126px;&quot; width=&quot;126&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;/thead&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;90&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessment of materials, objects, and sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Assess the impact of the environment &lt;em&gt;e.g. the temperature and light levels and their potential to cause changes to objects and collections. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Assess the physical nature of materials and collections.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Assess the condition of materials and collections&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Assess the historical and cultural significance of cultural heritage materials.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Undertake risk assessments on cultural heritage material &lt;em&gt;e.g. if preparing an object for exhibition they need to be able to judge the vulnerability of the object and identify possible damages that might occur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Consult and work with other allied professionals&lt;em&gt; e.g. a wall paintings conservator working within a building may work closely with architects and builders. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;126&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160; The agents of deterioration and materials science.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160; How objects may have been changed or damaged&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160; The wider cultural and historic significance of objects&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160; Conservation theory&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;90&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conservation options &amp;amp; strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;138&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Identify and evaluate conservation options&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Develop approaches for conservation issues which are non-routine and may be complex&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160; Advise on any legislation, official guidance or organisational policy that affects areas of conservation practice. e&lt;em&gt;.g.
