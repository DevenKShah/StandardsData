  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the specialist damp control and timber preservation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out a high standard of technical work relating to damp control and timber preservation issues. For example, rising dampness, penetrating dampness, atmospheric moisture, insect or fungi attack. The operative would need the necessary specialist skills to be able to effectively treat these issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a team of operatives, specialist damp and timber surveyors, clients, other trades, including electricians, general building contractors, etc.&#160; Specialist work is overseen by someone with an appropriate level of knowledge and expertise. The role may also interact with others including housing associations, councils or local authorities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for carrying out damp control and timber preservation works, lifting and moving materials, using a range of hand held tools and equipment, carrying preparation and reinstatement works and being able to carry out site clearance activities such as the removal of waste and the storage of excess materials. Whilst undertaking these activities, operatives are expected to adhere to strict codes of conduct and safe working practices including wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment, following the correct safe systems and taking action to minimise risk to self and others.The operative would need the relevant knowledge to be able to identify different types of building construction and type (for instance, different methods and materials used in construction) and adjust their working methods accordingly. The work carried out by a specialist damp and timber operative is unique in relation to the wider construction industry to prevent the deterioration of the fabric of the building. The materials, products and techniques that are used have been developed specifically to address the issues of the treatment of timber and damp above ground in buildings, including methods of application that work sympathetically with existing buildings. The role of the specialist damp and timber operative is vital in ensuring the relevant corrective treatment is carried out to the property to make sure that the property is not affected by the same issues in the future. The operative will need to understand all types of construction from foundation to roof in order to carry out the necessary treatments. They will have basic skills in plastering, joinery and bricklaying in order to make minor repairs to damaged elements. This will extend no further than minor repair work when necessary. For example the removal and replacement of skirting boards or flooring following timber treatment; or the removal and replacement of a small number of bricks following the installation of a telescopic air vent; or a small area of plastering.&#160; The operative has no supervisory responsibility. If the works relate to a listed building they will be supervised by someone with the appropriate level of knowledge of listed buildings and any remedial works will be undertaken by experts in that area. If major plastering, brickwork or joinery is required companies would contract in a damp and timber operative to carry out the required damp control or timber treatment. Only in these situations would there be interfacing with other trades. If an operative were to encounter a situation where extensive work in these areas was required they would feedback to their supervisor/company/client and advise accordingly.&#160; Operatives conduct and behaviour is particularly important as they represent not only the individual organisations undertaking the construction and renewals activities but the industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;",
