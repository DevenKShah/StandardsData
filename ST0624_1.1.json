  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Food and drink is one of the largest, most dynamic and fastest growing sectors of industry. Food and drink engineers maintain, manage and install a diverse range of specialist equipment and technology used in the manufacture of food and drink products. Combining engineering competence with an understanding of the principles of food safety, science and technology, their focus is on managing, maintaining and continuously improving existing assets. They operate within the confines and unique challenges of the sector. These include the variability of the product itself, the legal and regulatory framework, environment factors and customer and consumer expectations and standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They fulfil a variety of functions within food businesses, dealing with mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, process development and project engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They usually work as part of a team including other engineers and will interact with other functions and teams within their own company, such as manufacturing, production planning, health and safety and quality. They are responsible for their own work and may be responsible for teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship. Apprentices must complete the core and one option relevant to their role. There are two options:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mechanical&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;electrical&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
