The steel fixer will typically be working as part of larger team on a construction project in which they will have responsibility for positioning, assembling and fixing of different shapes and sizes of steel rebar the correct specification and tolerances. The steel fixer will be able to interpret contract information, drawings and specifications in order to assemble and install the components correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Construction Steel Fixer, Steel Fitter &amp;amp; Construction Site Supervisor&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Skills&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this apprenticeship construction steel fixers will have the following skills to be able to demonstrate the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply general workplace health, safety and welfare requirements when undertaking construction steel fixing activities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and undertake work practise productively.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply safe working techniques for moving, lifting and handling pre-assembled and manufactured elements, working at heights and using access equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read, interpret and work to drawings, specifications and construction information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assemble, position and fix manufactured elements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply safe use, storage and maintenance of hand tools, power tools and ancillary equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a range of reinforcing steel products to shape and assemble structures to specification, both on and off the construction site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cut, bend and connect reinforcing steel.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Position and fix pre-assembled elements and reinforcing steel according to specification.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this apprenticeship, construction steel fixers will have core knowledge of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the principles of health, safety and welfare and how they must be applied in relation to their own work and others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the responsibilities under current legislation, (including Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, Provision and Use of Workplace Equipment 1998, Working at Height Regulations 2005, Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992) and official guidance, (risk assessments, method statements and manufacturers guidance), to undertake work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to communicate with others and follow organisations procedures to conform to productive work practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the different and safe techniques to move, lift and handle pre-assembled and manufactured elements, and move, handle and store resources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to interpret information from drawings and specifications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to comply with specifications and drawings when assembling, positioning and fixing elements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the principles and practices of working at height and the use of access equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the different types of reinforcing bars and how they work together including joining and fixing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the methods for installing prefabricated and manufactured elements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to install reinforcing steel in situ.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the different methods and risks associated with working with reinforcing steel.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how off site construction projects operate as components are brought to site&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the implications of working with offsite manufactured components and the severity of potential outcomes if health and safety is not followed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective

Occupations (Construction) (QCF) and the Level 2 National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in Steel Fixing Occupations (Construction) (QCF).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression and Professional Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Progression from the Level 2 Apprenticeship could lead to an occupational or site supervisory role within the construction industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will deliver sufficient competence, underpinning knowledge and understanding in the identified job role to allow the individual to meet the requirements of the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS) or other industry affiliated schemes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English and Maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individuals without level 1 English and Maths will need to achieve this level and take the test for level 2 English and Maths prior to completion of their Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tandard Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed after three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
