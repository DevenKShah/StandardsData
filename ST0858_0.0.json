  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the healthcare sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers as well as some universities and research organisations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide expert clinical photography services, accountable for providing complex and critical video and clinical images to support patient care. Clinical photographers support the monitoring of patient treatment, aid diagnosis and enhance patient records as well as support clinical teaching, research and publication. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with multi-disciplinary clinical teams across all specialities, patients, relatives, management team, scientists, and academics. They also support external agencies such as the police, social workers and solicitors. Clinical photographers are usually hospital-based during core working hours, with out-of-hours working required for some specialist services. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for using professional judgement, planning and carrying out a broad range of highly specialised clinical photography, video and imaging to deliver accurate visual records of the progress of patientsâ€™ disease and treatment and at times are required to have direct physical contact with the patient. They will also capture clinical photographic evidence for safeguarding purposes and contribute photographic and video expertise to support major incident planning. As an autonomous practitioner, they have responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of the patient whilst in their care, supervision of apprentices and trainees and prioritisation of workload. As the first point of contact for the clinician, the clinical photographer must using professional judgement interpret their requirements to determine the most appropriate action. They are accountable professionally and legally for their actions and of those they are supervising, including the enacting of legislation such as patient confidentiality, record-keeping and risk management. They will critically evaluate the service and their own practice to influence and lead change initiatives within the service. Clinical photographers might work entirely alone (in smaller institutions or the private sector) or might be part of a larger team in a big organisation. They manage and operate professional-grade equipment, which might include (depending on the specialities they serve) highly-specialised instruments such as ophthalmic imaging (biomicroscope cameras, slit-lamp, OCT and other laser-scanning technologies), 3D scanning cameras and thermal imaging equipment. They are responsible for maintaining and using a range of specialist IT software.&lt;/p&gt;",
