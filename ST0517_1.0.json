  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapy is a rewarding career which requires a highly developed knowledge and professional skill-set to enable you to work across a range of settings and environments.&#160; Occupational therapists work with individuals from birth to end of life including those with physical and mental health conditions, injury, learning disabilities, long-term conditions, palliative care needs and with those who find themselves displaced from their societies.&#160; Your primary goal as an occupational therapist is to enable people to participate in meaningful occupations and activities of everyday life. &#160;Occupations include things people need to, want to and are expected to do such as self-care, leisure or work.&#160; Through therapeutic use of ‘occupation’ an understanding of the relationship between the human body and mind, what a person needs/wants to do, their beliefs and the physical and social environment, you will enable people who face disease, disability and/or social challenges to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life.&#160; You will use skills in clinical reasoning, critical analysis, and research based evidence in your practice.&#160; You will use a person-centred approach to support people to carry out everyday occupations and routines such as dressing, eating, catching the bus to work or other activities that are important to them.&#160; Occupational therapists also work with families, carers, employers and organisations that support the person as well as communities where people have become marginalised and require support to build a meaningful life.&#160; You can work in a variety of settings including health, social care, education and other private and voluntary sector organisations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duty of the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You work as an autonomous practitioner, either within a team or on an individual basis.&#160; Through assessment, intervention, critical reflection and the application of analytical skills, you demonstrate how you collaboratively reach solutions through occupations to the issues people face.&#160; You will be responsible and accountable for your decisions, and for reflecting on the effectiveness of your actions, with the aim of continually improving the service you provide.&#160; You demonstrate leadership and management qualities and are responsible for ensuring your own knowledge and skills are current.&#160; You are required within the professional and regulatory standards to contribute to the development of the profession by supporting student therapists and supervising those in other roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will be required to complete a BSc (Hons) degree in Occupational Therapy or Level 7 qualification approved &#160;by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and accredited by the Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT) where the apprentice already holds a Level 6 degree&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&#160;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completing the end-point assessment (EPA).&#160; For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 3 A levels or equivalent access qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional registration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On successful completion of an approved programme, apprentices are eligible to apply to the HCPC for registration as an Occupational Therapist, which is a requirement to practice under the protected title of Occupational Therapist.&#160; You will also be eligible to apply for Professional Membership of The Royal College of Occupational Therapists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;6&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;Typically 4 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date: &lt;/strong&gt;After 3 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Professional practice of occupational therapy&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional practice of occupational therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake occupational therapy assessment and interventions that demonstrate an understanding of the relationship between occupation and health and wellbeing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select and use appropriate methods to identify occupational strengths and needs, using activity analysis as a core tool of practice.
