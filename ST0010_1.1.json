They may be required to support customers in the UK and worldwide. Depending on the product, they may be required to work in confined spaces and at height. Depending on the nature of the work, they may be required to work shift patterns. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues across the organisation. For example manufacturing, project management, finance, human resources and procurement. They may also interact with customers, other specialist engineers, technicians, partners and suppliers. They will also work with different levels of engineers across multiple engineering disciplines. Depending on the organisation, they typically report to Senior Engineers, Senior Specialists or Chief Engineers.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for working ethically and professionally. Aerospace engineers work to Civil and Military Aviation regulatory requirements. They must meet statutory and company regulations, taking responsibility for health and safety. They also take responsibility for environmental and sustainablity regulations, cost, quality, accuracy and efficiency. They must proactively find solutions to problems and identify areas for business improvement. Aerospace engineers work individually and as part of a team. Depending on the size and structure of the organisation they may manage technicians or teams of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;",
