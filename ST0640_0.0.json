  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the science and engineering sectors of the Civil Nuclear and Defence Nuclear industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to use depth and breadth of scientific and engineering expertise in nuclear reactor technology to support all stages of the nuclear reactor lifecycle, including commissioning, operating and decommissioning. This involves independently performing technical assessment and scrutiny of designs and modifications, defining technical specifications against statements of requirement, developing innovative engineering solutions to in-service issues and providing senior leaders with technical knowledge and evidence based advice required to make informed decisions. Light Water Reactor (LWR) Scientists and Engineers are highly skilled using their knowledge and experience to understand the fundamental chemical, physical and radiological principles of nuclear reactor operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with technical and academic organisations, regulatory bodies, technical and non-technical people at all levels of the organisation. The working environment will mainly be office-based with some plant inspections and reviews; in the defence sector, an employee in this occupation may also operate the submarine reactor at sea. This is a highly technical role found in large multi-national organisations and in supply chain organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for budgets, licence requirements, health &amp;amp; safety, nuclear safety and security. This is a highly responsible role managing the maintenance of the LWR design intent. In particular, LWR Scientists and Engineers are responsible for the safety, reliability, operability and attributes of the LWR plant, assuring compliance with regulatory, contractual and internal company requirements. They are responsible for making recommendations to address fundamental issues and complex challenges to ensure continued safe operation, whilst also in some instances considering innovative ways to improve upon current designs to make nuclear power more effective and efficient for the future.&lt;/p&gt;",
