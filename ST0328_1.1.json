The Bespoke Saddler is a fundamental occupational role in the saddlery trade and is an integral part of an industry that contributes over &#163;8bn to the British economy. Bespoke Saddler is a broad description of someone who produces Saddles or Bridles and provides a comprehensive repair service to saddles and other equestrian equipment. All will be capable of producing a standard or bespoke product that is cut and made to a unique pattern or measurement for a horse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many of the skills are carried out by hand in order to produce an item that fits precisely to a customer’s requirements. Hand crafted products form the heart of the British Saddlery industry and have an international and iconic reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bespoke Saddlers have practical skills in the manufacture of equestrian products including measurement and pattern construction. The skills involved in Bespoke Saddlery cover a wide area of expertise that includes craft, technical, creative and design. These skills are fundamental to the Bespoke Saddlery industry and ultimately have to be employed with great precision, to high standards of excellence and within realistic time constraints.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of this standard the apprentice will be competent in both Saddle and Bridle making.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Skills &amp;amp; Knowledge: Saddle and Bridle making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the fashion &amp;amp; textiles sector, an integral part of the equine industry and is fundamental in the saddlery trade. There are 27 million people in Britain with an interest in the equestrian industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bespoke saddlers supply saddlery products for many professional equestrian sports such as horseracing, eventing, dressage and show jumping but also cater for the amateur rider.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Investing in a bespoke saddlery product could serve both horse and rider for many years if regularly maintained and cared for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most bespoke saddlers also offer a repair and restoration service as well as having an appreciation of the saddlery fitting process. The ability to assess the condition of leather is very important from a strength and durability perspective, if leather has been well cared for it is a very sustainable material that can last a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Finished saddlery products are key to equine welfare and must meet health and safety requirements as well as fitting both rider and horse comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most employers are based in a rural setting and classified as micro-businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to produce a range of hand-crafted saddlery products such as saddles, bridles or harnesses from leather to specific measurements for both horse and rider. Additional fittings and materials can be used also.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Preparatory duties include confirming customer order requirements to produce a bespoke specification to then produce a standard or bespoke product that is cut and made to a unique pattern or measurement for a horse. The skills involved in producing saddlery products cover a wide area of expertise that includes craft, technical, creative and design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bespoke saddlers implement a variety of hand craft practical skills in the manufacture of saddlery products including measuring, pattern construction, cutting, hand and machine stitching and finishing. Based in a workshop, bespoke saddlers may have to sit or stand for long periods of time at a bench whilst working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A typical working week is around 37 hours a week, from Monday to Friday but could occasionally include work overtime, which could include weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other work colleagues, customers and end-users. The level of interaction and responsibilities with external organisations would be dependent on whether the bespoke saddler is self-employed or an employee of a company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, they will work independently and will be responsible for attaining orders and may also come into contact with external suppliers of leather, fittings, materials and other accessories.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for carrying out hand craft practical skills in order to produce saddlery products that fit precisely to a customer’s requirements. These skills are fundamental to the bespoke saddlery industry and ultimately have to be employed with great precision, to high standards of excellence and within realistic time constraints and are central to the efficiency and effectiveness of manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an example, once the leather has been selected, little can be done to rectify mistakes and such errors will lead to problems at the assembly stage. Minimising loss of time and waste is key and contributes towards sustainability. All work must be completed in line with health, safety and environmental regulations and follow workplace safety rules in the workshop at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A bespoke saddler may work alone self-employed or more occasionally work in a larger workshop where the different stages are shared between several saddlers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
