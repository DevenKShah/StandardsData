Asbestos Analysts and Surveyors perform an essential role in the identification, analysis and monitoring of asbestos materials by assisting employers and property owners in understanding the risks asbestos presents and advising on how to control these risks. This occupational role is essential in order to ensure employers comply with the legal duties placed on them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role involves the inspection of buildings, premises and machinery for the presence of asbestos materials as well as the assessment of identified materials and the provision of information to employers to allow them to manage the risks the asbestos may present. The widespread nature of asbestos means visiting a wide range of building types including schools, offices, factories and homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to this, the role will involve the monitoring and management of asbestos removal operations. To ensure no conflict of interest the surveyor role does not involve removal work, which must be carried out by an independent organisation.

Removal contractors will carry out the removal and an independent surveyor will carry out final checks before the building is returned to the owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation involves working in a highly-controlled environment with all works being undertaken in accordance with strict regulatory guidelines, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and meeting the technical requirements of the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Competencies&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;142&quot;

Qualifications are written into the asbestos regulations in The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2012 and supporting Approved Code of Practice L143.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;RSPH Level 3 Award in Air monitoring and clearance procedures. RSPH Level 3 Award in surveying&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;RSPH Level 3 Award in Bulk Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All three qualifications as recognised by OFQUAL and recognised by United Kingdom Accreditation Service and referenced by The Health &amp;amp; Safety Executive and meeting the requirements of OFQUAL will be attained during the trailblazer scheme. Individuals cannot undertake any of the three disciplines without completing the qualification. This is a legal requirement as described in The Control of Asbestos regulations 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship scheme will be reviewed after a maximum of 3 years or as changes to regulations occur.&lt;/p&gt;",
