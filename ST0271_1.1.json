  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment construction sector. The construction industry is central to delivering the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure society demands. Steel Fixing is a core function within the construction sector. They work on various developments including commercial and industrial units, multi-storey housing and civil engineering projects like roadworks, tunnels and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to construct the steel reinforcement which forms a vital part of any concrete structure. A steel fixer constructs reinforcement for columns, beams, walls and floors no matter how big or small the construction project is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other trades such as formwork carpenters, groundworkers, scaffolders as well as supervisors, site management, architects, designers, contractors and customers. The working environment is often outdoors on a construction site and can be physically demanding. Steel Fixers often work at height such as on high rise buildings and therefore health and safety is of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, under supervision, using machinery and tools to create structures or components from the designs, digital model, plans and specifications of architects and designers that meet the clientâ€™s expectations. They construct the reinforcement structures by using steel wire to tie together various diameters of steel reinforcement bar or mesh matts, that will need to be cut to length, bent to shape and fixed together in order to complete a building&#39;s reinforced concrete structures. It is necessary to construct the steel reinforcement structures from the building&#39;s foundation to the highest point of the building/concrete structure. Steel fixers create the skeleton of a structure, constructing the steel reinforcement for ground beams, columns, floors, walls and slabs to which concrete is added to create the solid structure. Steel fixers cut and bend steel to form the structures as well as working with pre-manufactured and pre-fabricated elements. Components can be constructed in situ on a construction site where they are needed or constructed elsewhere, moved into position and tied into place. It is important that steel fixers work in a safe and accurate manner in order to complete the construction of the structure in accordance with the requirement set out in the construction drawings to maintain the integrity of the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
