  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers working in hospitals and clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to conduct diagnostic and screening ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound is the use of highly specialised scanning equipment to create echoes of high-frequency sound waves that can be bounced off body tissues. The echoes are then converted into an image called a sonogram. Ultrasound imaging allows an inside view of soft tissues and the body, to examine anatomy and identify problems. Sonographers perform and report a wide range of clinical ultrasound examinations within a defined area of practice. They undertake scans which may include but are not limited to cancer detection, women&#39;s health and pregnancy, abdominal, vascular and musculoskeletal examinations, although their individual scope of practice can be wide and varied. It requires extremely good hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness and excellent interpersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, their carers, members of the public and a range of healthcare professionals, e.g. doctors, midwives, nurses and radiographers. The sonographer will be competent to practice independently in this discipline but will work as part of a wider clinical team. They are independent professional practitioners responsible for managing their own work and for a wide range of specialist ultrasound scanning equipment and resources. They typically report to advanced practitioners, and may supervise healthcare assistants and clinical support workers.&lt;/p&gt;",
