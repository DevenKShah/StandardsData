  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the construction sector. Fenestration refers to the design, construction, or presence of openings in a building it can include windows, doors, louvres, vents, wall panels, skylights, storefronts, curtain walls, and slope glazed systems. Fabricators may supply directly to homeowners (retail/domestic market), the new-build market (house builders) or the commercial and public sector (local authorities, offices, shops, schools and hospitals etc). They can also supply the commercial refurbishment market.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of this occupation is to manufacture finished fenestration products such as conservatory roofing, curtain walls, glazed doors, glazed screening, roof lanterns, roof lights, patent/slope glazing, secondary glazing, shop fronts and windows. They usually specialise in a particular material – aluminium, timber, steel or uPVC and a range of products. They cut and assemble profiles together. Depending on the product they may add glass units, ancillary items for example, fixings and fastening, handles, hinges, locks and louvers, along with weatherproofing for example, gaskets, seals, membranes and sealants. Regardless of the product or material, it involves working to a specification, in line with quality standards, health and safety and environmental considerations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the production/general manager whom they report to and depending on the size of the organisation customers (internal/external), other fabricators, delivery personnel, design office, internal stores and suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing their own work, with minimal supervision, ensuring they meet set deadlines. They may work as part of a team, with responsibility for a specific aspect of the fabricator process, contributing to the production of the overall product.&lt;/p&gt;",
