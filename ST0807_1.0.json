  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in every sector and industry including manufacturing, retail, IT, automotive, service industries (financial services, health care, professional services, etc), and across large, medium and small commercial, public sector and not-for-profit organisations. Roles can sit within a specific company/agency that provides marketing deliverables and advice to external clients, or within an internal marketing team, delivering marketing activities to drive that business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to support customer focussed marketing activities that drive the demand for a product or service through awareness raising and/or perception building to generate results to the bottom line. As part of the Marketing team the Marketing Assistant will contribute to the implementation of the Marketing strategy and plans. They will be responsible for delivering day-to-day marketing activities across a multitude of platforms, channels and systems that are essential to the Marketing function and activities of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is typically the entry route for many Marketing professionals who progress their career into more senior marketing positions. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of internal colleagues and external marketing suppliers. Depending on the size and structure of the organisation, this could include collaboration with colleagues from sales, operations, PR, IT, the customer insight team and finance as well as interaction externally with clients/customers and suppliers such as printers, digital agencies, PR and media agencies, event display companies, market research agencies, and media sales professionals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The role is likely to be primarily office-based, although they may spend time away from the office attending exhibitions and events, meetings with external marketing suppliers, marketing research suppliers, visiting clients, trade shows, or supporting research activities. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for coordinating and delivering specific marketing activities which could include, but are not limited to, marketing content creation, background market and customer research, monitoring campaign analytic and collecting data, using relevant marketing software/systems, maintaining marketing administration activities such as managing the supply of marketing literature, tracking marketing expenditure, supporting the procurement of, and overseeing the delivery of work by external and internal marketing suppliers. The level of supervision is likely to vary for each employer, with the level of autonomy varying by size of organisation and marketing function. Typically they would be the first point of contact for day-to-day activities in the marketing function, and supervised by a member of staff with greater marketing skills, knowledge and experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the size of the organisation and its Marketing function, the Marketing Assistant may report into a Marketing Executive, a Marketing Manager, Marketing Director or (in small organisations) an Sales/Operational Manager or Managing Director.&lt;/p&gt;",
