  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in healthcare under the profession of dentistry. Dental hygienists are registered dental professionals who help patients maintain their oral and general health by preventing and treating periodontal (gum) disease and promoting good oral health practice. They carry out treatment direct to patients or under prescription from a dentist. Dental hygienists work in a clinical environment that could be located in the NHS or in the independent sector, in a general dental practice or in a hospital, a specialist dental practice, community dental service or in an armed forces dental clinic. They also treat individuals in their own homes or care settings if they are unable to access a dental surgery. They may work for an independent dental provider or own and operate their own independent dental hygienist practice. In addition to providing dental treatment, they deliver oral and systemic health advice to groups of all ages including antenatal groups, school children and health and social care staff to influence how they care for others. The clinical environment is called a dental surgery and consists of a dental chair, x-ray unit and various equipment and instruments required for dentistry. A dental hygienist should normally be assisted by a dental nurse and work as part of the wider team including for example dentists, registered dental specialists for example oral surgeons, clinical dental technicians, dental technicians, orthodontic therapists and dental therapists. Cross referral of patients between General Dental Council registrants is established practice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to promote oral and systemic health and save teeth by preventing and treating gum disease, especially those that have challenging oral conditions which make every day oral care difficult. Dental hygienists carry out procedures such as dental examinations including oral cancer screenings, taking x rays, scaling teeth, which maybe under local anaesthetic, polishing teeth and applying fluoride and sealant treatments. Dental hygienists will offer advice on maintaining good oral health and may refer onto other members of the team for further treatment. In NHS community services, dental hygienists work with a wide range of vulnerable patient groups that have special or additional needs. In a hospital, dental hygienists will manage and treat the oral health care needs of patients who may have had major surgery, such as head and neck cancer patients, complicated orthodontic treatment or have particular medical conditions meaning that they may be very ill, apprehensive or unsure after life-changing surgery. In addition, they provide oral health training to other members of the health care team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients, service users and carers. They will interact with other members of the dental team including dental nurses, dentists and registered dental specialists for example oral surgeons, clinical dental technicians, dental technicians, orthodontic therapists and dental therapists. They will also interact with other members of the wider education, health and social care team such as pharmacists, staff in care homes and schools and administration, management and other non-clinical staff, such as practice managers, suppliers of equipment, cleaners and receptionists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working within the limits of their competence and scope of practice to provide high quality, evidence-based care as part of the wider dental team. Dental Hygienists provide treatment and preventative care for people of all ages, different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs within a variety of environments. Dental hygienists are registered by the General Dental Council and must ensure that they only carry out a task, treatment or make decisions about a patientâ€™s care if they are appropriately trained, competent, indemnified and have the necessary skills. They may refer patients to other members of the dental team and to the wider healthcare team. Dental Hygienists must communicate effectively and be able to adhere to strict standards, including relevant legislation, when handling sensitive information. They promote a safe and healthy working environment and assess and manage risk. They engage in quality improvement activities and must continually develop their knowledge and skills, supporting others in the team to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;",
