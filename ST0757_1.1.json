  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Telecommunications operators, Ministry of Defence and their vendors and suppliers responsible for broadcasting digital voice and data services via radio frequency distribution architecture used in the telecommunications network.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This network will deliver these services to specific corporate, public, emergency services, third party radio network access providers or military organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure that digital data and voice networks operate at an optimal level and comply with the regulationâ€™s requirements. This is to provide the best possible service to their customers, working as part of an international,&amp;nbsp; national or regional radio network team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The individual may set up, configure, maintain and monitor radio networks to deliver data and voice services and operate processes for the design, installation, test, implementation, fault finding and optimisation of radio telecoms networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal and external customers, owners of site locations, equipment suppliers, internal teams, and cross functional leaders. Employees may be required to work at heights and in remote base stations so knowledge and compliance to health and safety relating to lone working and fall arrest techniques will be required.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation can be a mix of office work, on site work and field-based work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation may be responsible for managing radio network equipment to achieve network performance objectives in terms of service, coverage, quality and availability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will initiate, own and complete processes, tasks and procedures, supporting wider team to deliver long-term and short-term project priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will use their own initiative, work with minimal supervision, and report into a manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
