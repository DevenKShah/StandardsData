Not only will policy officers work within central and local government, but also within private and third sector organisations that interact with and strive to influence government policy.&#160; Policy officers will typically work as part of a wider team and report to a senior policy officer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The responsibilities of a policy officer encompass the development, implementation and evaluation phases of policymaking, and are likely to include: researching and understanding the political environment in order to support the continuous, uninterrupted development of a policy; gathering evidence and being objective to support the influencing and negotiating of new policies; handling sensitive information and keeping accurate records of policy history; assisting the wider team by providing administrative support during the introduction of new legislation; commissioning input from and preparing and drafting submissions for senior officials; and replying to public and formal correspondence within any deadlines given.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will decide the entry requirement for this apprenticeship, but typically this will be:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left: 20px;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;5 x GCSEs including English Language and Maths (or level 2 equivalent) at grade C and above (or the new grade 4 and above)&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Level 3 qualification(s), including at least one of the below:&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;ul style=&quot;margin-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;2 x A-levels at grade D and above;
