  "standardInformation": "&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of an air cabin crew member is to primarily ensure customers safety at all times whilst onboard the aircraft. They also provide excellent customer service to customers throughout the flight. They are trained to deal with security and emergency situations which may arise and can administer first aid to customers. Cabin crew may work for commercial organisations, working with large volumes of customers, or may work with small groups of customers on smaller aircraft. To achieve this, cabin crew are required to adapt to the needs of a wide range of individuals and customers and will need to understand how their needs can be accommodated. This may be from supporting nervous customers, individuals with young children, and those with special dietary or medical requirements. Some cabin crew may work as part of the armed forces, providing services for Royalty, Ministers and other dignitaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set their own entry requirements including the requirement for security clearance. Apprentices must be at least 18 years of age to work for a commercial airline (due to on-board sales) and 16 years of age to work for the Armed Forces&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will prefer that potential apprentices hold English and Maths GCSEs at an A to C grade. Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on the entry requirements the typical duration for this apprenticeship will be 12-18 months&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard is set at level 3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renewal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Three years from date of approval, unless there is evidence of significant industry change, which employers agree,
