  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Physiotherapy is a science-based profession. Physiotherapists work with individuals, and their families and carers, from birth to end-of-life and in a wide range of health and social care settings. They lead and deliver programmes and interventions to help people affected by injury, ageing, illness or disability. Physiotherapists use a range of physical and psychological treatment approaches, including movement, exercise and manual therapy, to optimise an individualâ€™s mobility, function and quality of life. They also provide education about health and wellbeing and provide specific advice that can be applied to everyday activities to manage and reduce the risk of pain or injury. The profession helps to encourage development, facilitate recovery and address health inequalities enabling people to remain independent for as long as possible. Physiotherapists practise as autonomous, independent practitioners, while contributing strongly to team-working. Individuals can seek care directly from physiotherapists and without referral from another professional. Physiotherapists work with people who may present with complex and challenging problems resulting from multiple illnesses, injuries or disabilities. In addition to providing physiotherapy interventions, they play a substantial educational, health coaching and advisory role with patients, other healthcare professionals and the public. Physiotherapists typically work in a range of large and small organisations across public, private and charitable sectors including physical health, mental health, forensic and prison settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
