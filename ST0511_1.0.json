  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Mineral and Construction industries employ around one and a half million people and contribute around &#163;17 billion to the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Mineral and Construction Product Sampling and Testing Operator collects and samples mineral products, heavy construction products and/or final end use products to ensure they meet rigorous British and European standards (BSEN) and to ensure they meet customer specifications. Materials can include ready mixed concrete, cement, mortar, asphalt, road building and high speed rail products, precast and pre-stressed concrete. They work in a range of subsectors including mining, construction, quarrying, road building, waste and recycling operations. As product failure and poor quality can lead to end use failure, expert knowledge and attention to detail is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Mineral and Construction Product Sampling and Testing Operator can:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collect and sample products at source and/or on customer site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Report findings verbally and in writing in accordance with BSEN standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Suggest ways to improve quality of products using knowledge of the material and production process.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use specialist equipment in order to grade materials, use compression and flexural testing equipment in order to measure strength, use nuclear density, thermocouples for temperature, slump and spread measurement equipment and methods for chemical analysis in order to check product quality, workability and consistency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare reports on quality measures and key performance indicators (KPIs).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Control raw material constituents by ensuring they are safely used and stored.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use their knowledge of materials to minimise waste and support recycling.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Diagnose faults with sampling/testing equipment taking steps to rectify them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They usually report to the technical site supervisor, but can also work autonomously and &#160;&#160;have the ability to make decisions. This is a key role supporting the entire production process. Due to the safety critical nature of the role, attention to detail is essential.&#160; Working safely and ethically is paramount as the sector is highly regulated so they always demonstrate an excellent understanding of site, regulatory, safety, health and environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the entry requirements for this apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table width=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 182px;&quot; width=&quot;182&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE&#160; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 517px;&quot; width=&quot;517&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;an understanding of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;182&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and safety &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;517&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the risks of activities and equipment both on site and within normal place of work.
