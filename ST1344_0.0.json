  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the civil engineering sector and deals with the engineering of tunnels and associated underground space structures. Tunnel engineers may work for contractors including large international companies through to Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs), asset owners and operators, consultants, developers and regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to plan, construct and maintain or repair tunnels and associated underground space structures in line with regulations and health and safety and environmental requirements, and to manage these processes.&amp;nbsp; They may work in part or throughout the project lifecycle, namely concept, feasibility, project selection, design, contracts, construction, testing, commissioning and handover, maintenance or repair and assets-in-service. At the planning stage of tunnels and associated underground space structure projects, tunnel engineers specify ground investigations, determine tunnel alignments through optioneering and identify the potential impacts of tunnelling or underground space works on the environment (urban, rural and natural). During the design phase, they model and analyse tunnels and associated underground space structures, considering face stability, soil-structure interaction and geotechnical and structural performance, impact on adjacent structures (surface and sub-surface) as well as serviceability and functional requirements. They manage construction activities during the undertaking of tunnel and ancillary underground space projects onsite with responsibilities including, but not limited to health and safety, quality control, temporary works, logistics, scheduling and risk management including ‘live’ monitoring. They also undertake operational and maintenance tasks associated with tunnels and associated underground space structures, during service, covering inspections, monitoring, as well as overseeing design and management of repair works. They are also responsible for producing technical reports across all stages of the project lifecycle and devising future maintenance strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their direct team within the organisation in which they work, as well as other internal teams, managers, and senior employees.&amp;nbsp; External to the organisation in which they work, they will interact with representatives from suppliers such as material and services, contractors, engineers, asset owners and operators, regulatory bodies, developers, and clients.&amp;nbsp; They will typically report to team leaders and directors within the organisation in which they work. Additionally, they will usually have technicians and junior engineers who report to them.&amp;nbsp; Some interaction with members of the public may also be necessary. They may work within a permanent employer’s office or on site or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for managing tunnel and associated underground space structure projects in relation to sustainability, risk, cost, programme, resource, health and safety, and the environment.&amp;nbsp; Tunnel engineers need to understand the standards, codes and regulations that they are required to comply with. Many design standards cannot be directly applied to tunnels and associated underground space structures, and a specialist knowledge base and specific experience within tunnelling projects is therefore required. The tunnel engineer understands and is able to evaluate the impact of commercial, contractual and legal requirements that are relevant to the projects they work on. They work within and adhere to their organisation’s processes and management systems. They undertake continued professional development, to keep abreast of recent tunnelling advances, regulations and processes in the field and support and actively encourage their teams to do the same.&amp;nbsp; They must undertake all tunnelling duties professionally and ethically to represent their organisations appropriately in all aspects of their work, adhering to all relevant regulations and codes of practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
