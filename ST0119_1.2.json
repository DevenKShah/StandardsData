  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations where digital technologies can be used to solve problems that exist across a range of functions. Whether looking for ways to reduce waste, increase productivity, ensure resilient and responsive customer service, or create a secure transactional environment, organisations turn to digital and technological solutions to achieve these aims. Wherever these activities take place Digital and Technology Solutions Professionals (DTSPs) are influencing outcomes and making things happen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DTSPs are found in small, medium and large organisations across all industries such as banking and finance, digital and technology, communications, construction, education, utilities, engineering, law, manufacturing, health, government and public services pharmaceutical, retail and transport. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to evaluate, initiate, create and support business solutions using digital technology. DTSPs use data to evaluate the commercial and security risks and benefits of potential digital and technology solutions before making recommendations for strategies that may have far reaching consequences. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DTSPs are influencers in their organisations with a clear focus on delivering business improvements through digital and technological solutions. They have a passion for digital technology; keeping in touch with emerging trends and developments . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DTSPs have a broad set of skills and knowledge across the main areas of the digital and technology landscape. This enables them to understand the complexity of information systems, systems development, data, cyber security, business organisation, IT project management and computer and network infrastructures . They view all of this with a rigorous approach to commerciality and budget to deliver quality solutions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this broad set of skills and knowledge they specialise in one of the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 1: Software Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 2: IT Consultant&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 3: Business Analyst&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 4: Cyber Security Analyst&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 5: Data Analyst&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 6: Network Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;In a manufacturing company DTSP Software Engineers could be developing solutions to support the construction of physical products.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In a utility company DTSP IT Consultants could be on a remote site to implement a solution for improving energy usage or reducing outages through the application of new technologies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In an engineering company DTSP Business Analysts could be reviewing a change to an engineering process to determine the impact on other processes within the organisation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;in a technology company DTSP Cyber Security Analysts could be working with clients to address security management issues in the clients’ processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In a pharmaceutical company DTSP Data Analysts could be working with large amounts of information to interpret the results of a field trial of a new medicine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a communications company DTSP Network Engineers could be involved in developing additions to an existing national network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work DTSPs are excellent communicators and may interact with internal and external customers, team members and senior leaders. They can work independently and within multi-disciplinary teams . They may interact with decision-makers, strategists, and policymakers, often in senior roles in private or public sector organisations as well as with individuals and groups (internal and external) with a stake in the defined system, currently or in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation is likely to have some responsibility for budgets and/or resources, teams, and projects. In some organisations they may hold leadership positions. Work may typically be conducted in a desk-based environment, but that desk may be in an office or on a site depending on the solution being worked upon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example. a DTSP Software Engineer could be working on a client’s site during the development and implementation of a new client system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working with little or no supervision and may be accountable for the supervision of others if the position requires it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DTSPs are at the heart of problem solving, bringing an innovative, multi-disciplined approach to bear where there are unpredictable and variable influencing factors. They may have a remit to commission work from others and hold them accountable for outputs of a technical nature. Their professional position within a business means they fulfil a leadership role within their technical specialism demonstrating a strong ethical awareness of technological trends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A description of each specialism follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Option 1) Software Engineer&lt;br /&gt;The primary role of the Software Engineer is to undertake all requirements during the solution development life-cycle from gathering requirements to analysis, design, code, build, test, implementation and support.
