  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the furniture and interiors industry. Furniture restorers repair and protect pieces of modern and old furniture, returning them as closely as possible to their original condition. They normally work with wood, but some pieces may include other materials such as ivory, bone, mother of pearl, pewter, brass , silver and other metals, stone and precious stones and marbles. As well as furniture, they may work on other objects made of wood such as musical instruments. Furniture Restorers tend to work in small workshops, but can also work on historical and heritage sites, such as stately homes or in museums, with national historic or private collections. Employers vary in size from small to large. Furniture Restorers repair, revive and renovate furniture. The work can range from minor repairs, such as re-gluing an arm or drawer, to completely rebuilding a piece, including making identical replacement components. Conservation is the care or treatment that repairs damage and takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object. Restoration is the care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function. Activities will vary depending on the pieces being restored or conserved and the needs of the customer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is the restoration and conservation of antique and modern furniture. They use traditional and scientific restoration and conservation techniques. They assess, evaluate and research agreeing the scope of the work with customers. They identify tools, materials, set up and operate machinery. They repair, replicate and restore components and finish surfaces using basic methods. They re-upholster and apply decorative effects. They also carry out basic maintenance and maintain the work area. They identify and solve problems, complete reports and issue aftercare instructions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other restorers, other craftspeople, suppliers and customers. They typically report to a manager or business owner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality of their own work and meeting customer deadlines and requirements. They also make recommendations to customers on the restoration, treatment options and aftercare instructions. They must work within health and safety and environmental and sustainability regulations. This includes use of appropriate protective clothing and equipment. Depending on the size of the organisation, they may be required to work on their own, or they may work as part of a wider team.&lt;/p&gt;",
