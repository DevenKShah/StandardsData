  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment construction sector. The construction industry is central to creating the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure society needs.&amp;nbsp;There is growing demand for carpenters and joiners to help meet the need for the transition to modern methods of construction, heritage projects and sustainability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is working with wood-based materials and associated products to create and install complex building components.&amp;nbsp;This typically involves shaping and cutting materials, installing finished materials like complex or decorative components. All work needs to be carried out safely, using the appropriate tools and to the quality specified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation includes two different options and people will either work on a construction site as an Advanced Site Carpenter or in a workshop as an Advanced Architectural Joiner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advanced Site Carpenters work on building sites in the construction of domestic and commercial properties, preparing and installing complex and bespoke building components. They prepare, construct and erect irregular and complex roof structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advanced Architectural Joiners are employed in a workshop creating complex building components by setting out, marking out and create assembled products requiring advanced skilled work including the full range of woodworking machines. There will often be a need for refurbishment or repair work of bespoke pieces. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation liaises with other construction roles such as bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers, supervisors, site management, architects, designers, contractors and customers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, lead others, using machinery and tools to create, refurbish or repair structures or components. Having attained this level of competence, they could progress further in the industry as team leaders, trade forepersons, contract or works managers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
