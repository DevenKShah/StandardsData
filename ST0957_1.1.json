  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in public and private sector organisations working to address complex problems in which understanding location is essential. A Spatial Data Specialist uses Geographic Information Systems and other geographic technologies to capture, manage, represent, measure and analyse location data and monitor their changes over space and time. They use advanced spatial analysis and modelling to produce maps, visualisations and other communications to represent and explain relationships between location and other data. Understanding and analysing location data is a complex and specialised task. Location data analysis, spatial modelling, digital mapping and visualisation have developed through Geography and Geographic Information Science, a field of research and professional practice that stands alone from data science and data analysis. They may help organisations achieve net zero carbon emissions by identifying how location specific factors have an impact. This information can help inform strategies for good management of natural resources and environments. They may inform decision making on major infrastructure projects and provide analysis that helps to address geohazards and other risks. Their interpretation of location information may help businesses plan efficient and sustainable supply chains or provide services to communities. Their insight supports specialists in other fields to make decisions in location-sensitive ways. Depending on the sector a Spatial Data Specialist may work with a range of people. These could include environment and infrastructure managers, engineers, data scientists, planners, architects, IT professionals, insurance and risk managers, sustainability professionals, and policy makers. The Spatial Data Specialist always pays attention to the ethics, risks, limits or biases of their data and analysis when giving their insights. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The occupation initiates and leads programmes and projects which use location as the ‘golden thread’ to link, analyse and gain insight from multiple datasets. They enable stakeholders to gain greater value, insight and further opportunities from all their data by linking it to the real world. This is especially applicable to the green economy, in addressing the challenges of net zero and climate change, and in addressing inequality. For example such as green building, smart cities, noise mapping, air quality modelling and ecological assessments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Spatial Data Specialist differs from a data scientist in how they approach a problem. While a data scientist could identify a link between environment and health, a Spatial Data Specialist will also show you where those links have a large or small impact. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation interacts with a broad range of people, often in multi-disciplinary teams. They provide location-based analysis, mapping, visualisation and insight to specialists in other fields across their organisation and sector. They may also work with external partners such as local and international businesses, governments, regulators, and academic research scientists. They are often asked to create maps and visualisations that communicate complex data for non-technical and public audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for delivering advanced spatial analysis, mapping, visualisation and insight. They will use accurate, current and well-structured collections of location data, primarily in Geographic Information Systems. They will interpret stakeholder needs and business requirements to select the most appropriate data and, spatial methods. They will produce location information analysis and products that will engage customers or stakeholders, organise and represent complex information and help solve business problems. They will provide technical authority regarding the legal, safe, secure, effective and ethical uses of location data. They will lead the adoption of international and national location data standards, frameworks and best practices at project and organisational levels. Spatial Data Specialists normally report to senior managers and decision-makers.&lt;/p&gt;",
