  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the construction sector and across the built environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide specialist, fire-related information across the built environment to protect people and property from the destructive effects of fire by applying science and engineering principles. Fire Safety Engineers identify risks and design safeguards to aid the prevention, control and mitigation of the effects of fire. Their role is to provide technical advice to develop design solutions within the built environment at various stages of projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation will work as part of an integrated team of engineers and other construction or regulatory professionals through all stages of development, design, construction, commissioning, operation, maintenance, modification and decommissioning of the built environment infrastructure. A Fire Engineer may be required to have a broad knowledge base to work across a diverse spectrum of built environment projects including high rise, residential buildings; shopping centres; multi-storey commercial, healthcare buildings; or road and rail tunnels. A Fire Safety Engineer might work in public or private sector organisations, including local authorities, fire and rescue services, central government departments and agencies, engineering consultancy firms, contracting firms, or construction companies. A Fire Safety Engineer will be required to use professional judgement and research-based knowledge to justify and apply guidance or accept departures from recognised guidance documents and to be able to use mathematical and scientific skills to measure and evaluate risks from fire to people, structures and the environment.&#160; A Fire Engineer will also contribute towards making improvements to the professional fields of fire safety and fire engineering.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will typically have management and supervisory responsibility for a team of technicians, including apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;",
