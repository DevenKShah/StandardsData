  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A laboratory scientist applies specialist knowledge and broad scientific understanding to carry out a range of technical and scientific activities in their specialist discipline: Chemical Science, Life Sciences, Research &amp;amp; Development, and Analytical.&amp;nbsp; They analyse, interpret and evaluate relevant scientific information, concepts and ideas and use these to develop subsequent experiments or investigations and to propose solutions to problems&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; They identify areas of business improvement and propose innovative scientific ideas. They perform practical, established and novel laboratory procedures using standard and specialist laboratory equipment and instrumentation. Ensuring uniformity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility, quality, and integrity of scientific tests underpins their work and the working environment. In all contexts working safely and ethically is paramount. &amp;nbsp;Laboratory scientists work in a wide range of organisations, including chemical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, formulated products, consumer products, nuclear and analytical services.&amp;nbsp; They work autonomously on defined projects under the supervision of a senior scientist and as part of a wider scientific team, which may include laboratory technologist and laboratory technicians.&amp;nbsp; They deliver scientific value to their organisation, whilst contributing to the development of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include: Analytical Chemist, Research &amp;amp; Development Scientist, Molecular Biologist, Formulation Scientist, Medicinal Chemist, Process Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst any entry requirements will be a matter for individual employers, typically, candidates will have 5 GCSE’s at grade C or above, including English, maths and a science subject and hold relevant level 3 qualifications providing the appropriate number of UCAS points for entry to a level 6 Higher Education programme. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, skills and behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, in relation to one of the following specialist disciplines where indicated - Chemical Science, Life Sciences, Research &amp;amp;
