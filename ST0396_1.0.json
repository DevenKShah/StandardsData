  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Cultural Learning and Participation Officers (CLPO) plan, organise and co-ordinate artistic and cultural education workshops, schedules of activity and community engagement projects that will vary in duration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The activities that are planned, organised and co-ordinated by the CLPO, typically include teaching arts, culture and heritage subjects, creative workshops, visits, talks, performances, festivals, events and digital arts, using online content and social networks as appropriate. Activities may be accessed in cultural venues, online (through delivering webinars) and other settings for example schools, hospitals, prisons and community settings such as care homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These activities act as a vehicle to enable learning, skills development, wellbeing, social inclusion and community engagement. They use arts and culture to enhance and improve learning about wider subjects e.g. teamwork, communication, resilience and may use activities that include dance, music, drama or provide curriculum resources in the arts. The activities are aimed at diverse audiences e.g. children, young people, vulnerable adults and local community groups (youth theatre groups or charities) to ensure they have a range of opportunities to access, create and benefit from artistic and cultural activities e.g. learning an instrument; improving communication skills&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CLPOs work to agreed internal and external activity briefs which will usually be focused on subjects and themes associated with their organisation. The brief will outline key requirements for example: implement a series of artistic workshops or events. CLPOs are required to gain the necessary knowledge about the subject or theme prior to the activity taking place by undertaking research about it and applying their own learning and skills to design, implement and deliver in ways deemed appropriate for the participant. They will need to consider the impact of cultural differences, how to overcome barriers to inclusion and demonstrate the social benefits of engaging with hard to reach groups. Typically, they will be expected to make decisions regarding booking venues, appropriate artists, advertising, appropriate audiences, taking feedback and fundraising activities. They may have many activities happening at one time and need to keep accurate records and stakeholders updated. They are also expected to operate within strict budgets, delivering to agreed deadlines and standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are employed by arts and cultural organisations such as galleries, museums, theatres, orchestras, concert halls, arts centres, dance companies, heritage sites and local authorities. They may be the only CLPO or work with other CLPOs/in a team that may consist of artistic producers, cultural learning and participation managers, administrators and artists. They also work with artists, partners and other external practitioners such as designers, historians, conservators, scientists, mental health practitioners and teachers to ensure that the projects meet objectives and are successful. CLPOs are likely to work across one or more art form such as visual, performing, digital, media or literary arts or with collections in heritage organisations such as museums.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must maintain knowledge, and comply with, up to date safeguarding regulations, and may act as the lead for safeguarding in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set their own entry requirements. &#160;Typically an Enhanced DBS check may be required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 188px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 20px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;height: 20px;&quot; colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLPOs will have the following knowledge and understanding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 21px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 21px;&quot;&gt;Understanding audiences and effective methods of engagement&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 21px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical and specific needs, priorities and expectations of a range of existing and potential new audiences and participants that the organisation wishes to engage and how to find out audience data/information.
