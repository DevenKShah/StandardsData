  "standardInformation": "&lt;h2&gt;OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The construction sector is the driving force behind the UK economy, employing three million people and contributing 6.4% of GDP. Not only that, the construction industry is central to delivering the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure our society demands. A career in the construction industry is like no other. Bricklaying is a core function within the construction sector, particularly the house building sector. The Government has a target to build significantly more new homes over the coming years and therefore the demand for bricklayers has never been higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bricklayers lay bricks, blocks and other types of building components in mortar to construct and repair walls, foundations, partitions, arches and other structures eg chimney stacks. They might also refurbish brickwork and masonry on restoration projects. The range of sites and projects that bricklayers will work on include large commercial developments, new builds in housing, alterations, extensions and restorations. A bricklayer may work one-on-one or on larger jobs where their bricklaying group (gang) may work on a particular section of a building alongside other bricklaying gangs as well as other trades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;CORE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND BEHAVIOUR REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health and safety: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Health and safety hazards, current regulations and legislation including COSHH/risk assessments and understanding the importance of method statements.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment sectors of the construction industry. Projects vary in size, scale, and duration, ranging from the repair of a garden wall to new build housing and large-scale commercial projects such as office blocks, hospitals and retail developments. Employers and contractors of bricklayers vary in size from small, local family building companies to major home builders and commercial contractors. Bricklayers sometimes choose to specialise in certain types of projects and go on to become masters in their field. Examples include refurbishment work, new build homes or commercial works. There is growing demand for Bricklayers to help meet the need for new homes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to lay bricks and blocks, sometimes utilising modern methods of construction and premanufactured elements to construct walls. Bricklayers carry out simple setting out, prepare mortar and use a trowel to lay bricks, mortar and apply damp-proof materials to complete the project to specification and required design. Bricklayers use spirit levels and plumb lines to check building alignment and use hammers and chisels to shape and trim bricks and blocks. Bricklayers typically work outdoors on construction sites, in most weathers and at height. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their immediate team and the site management team, which could include a senior or craft bricklayer providing advice and guidance. They would also often liaise with other construction trades such as site carpenters and roofers who could work for their own organisation or another contractor. Site managers again could work for their own company or the main contractor. In the case of smaller projects such as house extensions, liaison with the client, neighbours and officials such as building control surveyors would be expected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for creating a high-quality product which meets standards, specifications and design plans. They are expected to do this with due regard to all safety aspects involved with working on a construction site, ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of themselves and others at all times. With sustainable construction at the forefront of all projects, it is expected they would give consideration to the environment and sustainability of materials, waste awareness and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;",
