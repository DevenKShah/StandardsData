  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a range of services that embed peer-led roles within third sector, community, social enterprise and statutory sectors, including the NHS, health, justice, housing, and private providers of specialist services. Peer support has a long history in social justice, human rights and community action. The occupation is unique in that it is only open to those who have expertise through lived experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peer Workers support individuals across all age groups who may be experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;severe mental distress&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;mental health crises&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;perinatal mental health difficulties&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;long term conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;addiction problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;problem gambling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;rough sleeping.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of this occupation is to work alongside other professionals in hospital, justice and community settings, providing peer support for individuals using knowledge gained from their own lived experience of health or social problems and/or using services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peer support is founded on a non-coercive, human rights-based approach that focuses on building relationships. Working within clearly agreed boundaries, Peer Workers purposefully share their own experiences, and through the mutual sharing and commonality of experience, they can embody hopefulness. They maintain equality with, and work alongside, others facing similar experiences and challenges in their health and wellbeing. Their work is underpinned by mutuality and reciprocity, widely recognised as core principles of peer support, with the central focus being on building trusting relationships rather than intervention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an autonomous member of the multi-professional team, the Peer Worker works with individuals through 1-to-1, group-based, drop-in and online/remote contact, focusing on building relationships and opportunities to learn together. They draw on their own lived experience as the foundation for supporting individuals to move towards user-led goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peer Workers support individuals to build skills through modelling, signposting, and self-advocacy. They work directly with individuals, enabling them to find their own ways of understanding their circumstances in order to move forward. Creating a safe and trusting space provides for an honest and open dialogue in which different experiences can be shared and different ways of understanding can be considered. Using knowledge from their own lived experiences of challenges, accessing support and navigating a range of services, a Peer Worker can provide purposeful and safe disclosure of their personal experiences to share and model self-help and self-management skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work as part of a team to provide peer support in combination with the individuals’ service-led care and support plans. They complement, as well as provide alternatives to a wider package of care and support involving multiple agencies. They will report to the Team Manager/Care Co-ordinator and will have access to both line management and peer supervision that can be in either a 1-to-1 or group setting. Peer supervision opportunities are used by the Peer Worker to reflect on, evaluate and develop the way they work. Examples of peer supervision conversations include discussing issues of mutuality and equality, ethical dilemmas and when to challenge practices that exert power and control and restrict the choice of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They provide intentional peer support within the context of empowerment, choice, self-determination, and self-managed care. They support individuals and carers to gain an increased sense of control within their own unique circumstances and connection to local communities. They also facilitate mutually-negotiated practical assistance, promoting the individual’s awareness of social networks, activities, groups or other opportunities in which they have expressed an interest, and how these can be accessed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with&#160;the wider team working alongside other professionals and has direct contact with individuals as well as their families and carers. As members of multi-professional teams, their key relationships may include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Practitioner Psychologists&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;members of the nursing team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;housing support workers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Psychiatrists&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social Workers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Occupational Therapists&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;custodial and probation services&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;police&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;teachers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;Peer Workers may also interact with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;external partnership agencies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;local Recovery Colleges&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;employment programmes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;self-help groups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;education setting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;leisure and community centres that promote social inclusion opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for delivery of peer-based approaches as agreed with individuals and groups within the peer relationship. Peer Workers use intentional, experiential sharing to support individuals to identify and work toward self-defined goals. In their interactions, they draw on their lived experience of overcoming challenges and accessing resources, whilst being mindful of applying peer-based approaches when sharing those experiences, e.g. underpinning conversations with a trauma-informed approach. Through the peer relationship and principles of co-production, the individual and Peer Worker will co-develop and work towards self-defined goals. The Peer Worker supports individuals through significant changes in their life circumstances and facilitates access to different sources of support to build or re-establish trust and relationships with services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will collate information on available services with the individuals they are supporting, such as housing, benefit entitlements and wider community resources. Using effective communication, Peer Workers support individuals to understand their rights and choices so they are in a better position to self-advocate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They challenge risk-averse workplace culture and encourage positive risk taking when supporting individuals to move towards self-defined goals. Peer Workers take an active role in promoting and modelling peer values within the service setting they work in, for example promoting a strengths-based approach or co-production. They aim to improve the organisational understanding of lived experience which can lead to wider discussions within the service setting they work in around systems change and improving staff well-being. They can be actively involved in service improvement initiatives, contributing ideas to the multi-professional team or other relevant staff committees to encourage commitment to a personal recovery and wellbeing-orientated culture. They also support training and development activity, which can include awareness training for staff around the role of Peer Workers and wellbeing training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peer Workers embody the values of peer support and use peer-based approaches in all their work-related interactions. By safely sharing their lived experiences, they can help to positively challenge stereotypes that co-workers and partner agencies may have toward, for example, mental health or substance misuse. Issues they may challenge in these situations include the stigma that can surround individuals with mental health experiences, low expectations (e.g. of workplace capability), and discriminatory practices against such individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Peer Workers recognise the importance of self-care. They maintain accurate records of their work as required. Where appropriate, records will be co-produced with the individual they are supporting. They are also responsible for ensuring that resources are managed effectively. They may work shifts including unsocial hours and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;",
