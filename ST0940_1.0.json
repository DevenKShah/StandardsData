  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a multitude of sectors including but not limited to: videoconferencing and online events, academic institutions, banks, law firms, insurance providers, financial service providers, government agencies, hospitals, software developers, galleries, museums, and other live event spaces/venues. Audiovisual (AV) professionals are employed in fixed ‘site-specific’ roles (institutions, event spaces, offices, meeting rooms) and on ‘touring’ events in venues of various sizes requiring AV infrastructure (from small clubs to stadiums). Some of this work is carried out at height. The Audiovisual industry is forecast to be worth $230 billion by 2023 (The Audiovisual and Integrated Experience Association).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide a broad range of professional solutions for communication including videoconferencing, hybrid in-person/online events, sound, lighting, projection, and computer networking by planning, installing, configuring, and operating hardware and software. AV hardware includes audio mixing desks, video cameras, public address systems, display screens, projectors, wireless microphone systems, recording devices, lighting systems, encoders/decoders, and network switchers. AV software includes videoconferencing platforms, digital audio workstations, video editors, media servers, sound-reinforcement design/control, lighting design/control, and computer networking tools. Integrated AV involves the combination, design, and system control of the hardware/software specified above to meet unique specifications. Depending on the context, a range of working patterns are applicable including standard office hours and shift work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other members of their own team, and in the course of their normal duties will interact with their line manager, senior management, potential and confirmed clients (internal/external to the employer), event organisers, public speakers, performers, AV support teams, external contractors, personal assistants, and company directors/CEO’s.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible, under minimal supervision, for design, setup, and delivery of audiovisual provision in accordance with the specifications of internal and external stakeholders. Depending on the core business of their employer these activities might be focussed on time-based events (online, in-person, and hybrid) or permanent communication systems. All of the above activity requires systematic project management skills, an evaluative approach, and the ability to synthesise client requirements, project specifications, and budget. Employees are responsible for determining the best course of action and implementing theoretical/technical knowledge in order bring projects to fruition. Additionally they are responsible for upholding institutional/national health and safety guidelines, meeting specific client requirements on time, and responding to change requests (late or otherwise) in a professional manner.&lt;/p&gt;",
