  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A textile manufacturing operative is someone who is employed within the textile manufacturing industry and works in an occupation (job role) where they are required to use specific machinery to produce textiles. Typically, this might involve occupations such as carding, spinning, twisting, warping and other roles at the basic/introductory level of the textile manufacturing (this is not an exhaustive list). These individuals are known as ‘operatives’ by the sector and would typically report to a Technician, Supervisor or Line Manager. The key responsibility for a Textile Manufacturing Operative is to ensure the consistency of textile production in a manufacturing facility. The majority of individuals enrolled onto this standard will work within businesses that employ less than 250 employees although, companies that are part of larger organisations are likely to use this programme. Upon completion of this standard, individuals will be competent in specific textile manufacturing operations appropriate to their own occupational role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria and specify the entry requirements applicable to their area of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 749px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 706px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE: Individuals must know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand the Industry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 678.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the textile manufacturing sector, its history, heritage and importance that textile manufacturing has on the economy, how the industry started, how mechanisation changed production and have a basic knowledge of the textile manufacturing processes, how advancements in innovation have improved the sector, including where new technology is under development and the evolution from traditional to modern manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/ Customer Base&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 678.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the basics of the supply chain, how goods and services arrive at the business and where they go to after being manufactured, the importance of a positive customer experience, the roles involved in production and the importance of multi-skilling the workforce. &#160;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health, Safety &amp;amp; Welfare (Legislation):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 678.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how the Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work Act applies to textile manufacturers (including areas of legislation specific to Noise, Dust, Fire, Occupational Health and Working Time Regulation), have an understanding of safety processes, safety management, effective risk assessment and hazard identification in the work area.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 27.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw Materials&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 678.5px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the raw materials associated with textile production, from raw fibre processing to completed product.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Textile manufacturing operatives work in the manufacturing sector. They make or provide services for textile materials such as cotton and silk fabrics, or woollen yarns and cloth. They may be used in clothing, home and interiors sectors, and many other products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers range in size, mainly small-medium. They work in a manufacturing facility.&#160; &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Textile manufacturing operatives use specialist machinery to produce textile materials. This might involve processes such as blending, carding, coating, dyeing, inspection and testing, printing, spinning, scouring, twisting, and warping, weaving and finishing.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also complete quality checks, prepare materials for the next stage in the process and complete work records. Conducting basic machine maintenance is also part of the role. They also contribute to maintaining the work area and improvement work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work with other members of the production team. They may also have contact with people from other functions for example, quality, engineers, and warehouse staff. They may work alone or as part of a team, under supervision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They must ensure that their work meets quality requirements and supports production plans. They must work to health and safety rules. This may include wearing personal protective equipment. They must also support sustainability. For example, by minimising waste and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;",
