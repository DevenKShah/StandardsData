Typically the work is undertaken in a dental laboratory on a prescription from a dentist. The work can broadly be split into crown &amp;amp; bridge, dentures and orthodontics; most labs specialise in one or two of these areas but during the apprenticeship Dental Technicians will develop competency across all disciplines from start to finish before choosing if/where to specialise once they are qualified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dental Technicians tread a fine line between art and science; they manufacture precise custom-made medical appliances but require the attention to detail, colour and manual dexterity that is expected of fine artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dental Technicians are registered professionals and work within the standards and scope of practice defined by the General Dental Council (GDC) Scope of practice Document September 2013 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gdc-%20uk.org/Newsandpublications/Publications/Publications/Scope%20of%20Practice%20September%202013.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://www.gdc- uk.org/Newsandpublications/Publications/Publications/Scope%20of%20Practice%20September%202013.pdf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working as part of the Dental Team Dental Technicians will need to comply with professional regulation, collaborate with dental practices and occasionally meet patients. Dental Technicians will be able to work with minimum supervision and are responsible for the quality of their finished work before it is released to the dentist and patient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;120&quot; style=&quot;width: 120px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;owledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;544&quot; style=&quot;width: 544px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Dental Technician will have knowledge of:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oral Anatomy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Normal dental/oral anatomy and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dental devices and combating oral problems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How design of custom-made devices can contribute to restoration of functionality as well as prevention of oral disease/further decline.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing Procedures&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The procedures used in design and manufacture of custom made devices - dentures, crowns, bridges, orthodontic (including Computer Aided Design (CAD)/ Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) &amp;amp; IT Solutions).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Material Selection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The principles regarding the selection and use of materials for use in custom made dental&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;devices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Dental Team and Professionalism&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of Dental Technician and other dental team members in management and leadership, professionalism and communication.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;120&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Medical Devices Directive &amp;amp; GDC Guidelines&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;544&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Compliance with the Medical Devices Directive Council 93/42/EEC (MDD), GDC standards for Dental Team, Scope of practice &amp;nbsp;http://www.gdc-uk.org/Newsandpublications/Publications/Publications/StudentFtPApril10web_260310[1 ].pdf&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;131&quot; style=&quot;width: 131px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;334&quot; style=&quot;width: 334px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Dental Technician will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;131&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Appropriate Device Selection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;334&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advise the prescribing dentist on appropriate dental devices based on dentist input, while recognising oral limitations and their effect on devices.
