  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Road Surfacing Operative (RSO) is a multi-disciplined role critical to the country’s infrastructure. RSOs are responsible for the surfacing, resurfacing and improvement of vast stretches of the public and privately owned highway network, covering all road types from motorways to residential streets. Approximately 20 million tonnes of asphalt is laid each year by RSOs. Operatives work in a wide range of different environments and will spend the majority of time outside.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical duties include: the operation of a wide range of specialist plant machinery such as planers, asphalt pavers, emulsified bitumen sprayers and compacting rollers; the removal of old/existing surfaces using a mechanical breakup process; the visual inspection and preparation of the underlying surface to receive new surfacing material; the resurfacing of the prepared area using a range of road surfacing machinery often covering vast areas; the alignment and then compaction of the new surface; and the visual inspection and testing of the new surface to ensure full compliance with the specified design.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;RSOs will work as part of a team, known as a gang, of between 8 and 14 people directed by a foreman and/or supervisor. Operatives will perform multiple roles within the gang including machine driver, machine operator, roller driver, rake hand, planer driver, and planer operator. As well as being excellent team players, RSOs must develop a safety-first attitude, learning how to carry out works without risk to themselves, others or the environment. They must also be adaptable, prepared for outdoor working and a variety of shift patterns in order to minimise disruption to the road user and travelling public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers of all sizes exist within this industry, from small enterprises running a single gang to multi-national organisations involved in operations across numerous countries and continents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Road Surfacing Operatives are required to know and understand:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The various road surfacing techniques including the application and use of primers, epoxy or thermoplastic resins, bituminous emulsions, and various types of aggregate including their limitations and characteristics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to work in accordance with the National Highway Sector Schemes, Industry Codes of Practice, the New Roads &amp;amp;

For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and Maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language qualification is an alternative to English qualifications for those for whom this is their primary language.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard Review: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed after three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
