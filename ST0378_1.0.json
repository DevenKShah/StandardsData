  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A blacksmith is someone who uses their craft, art or skill to design, shape and join metal components by hot forging and other metal working processes for small batch or bespoke production and/or heritage metalwork conservation.&amp;nbsp; The job may involve the production of large or small-scale work ranging from architectural ironwork such as public art sculptures, gates and railings, to domestic decorative and functional objects such as furniture, fireplace tools, and mirror frames. &amp;nbsp;Also produced are tools for themselves and other crafts such as tongs for the forge, wood turning tools for the local carpenter as well as industrial tools such as spanners or forged components for delivery to a factory as part of a production line. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will be using forged metals (mainly ferrous) often combined with other mixed media sometimes working in collaboration with other crafts persons. &amp;nbsp;Blacksmiths most commonly work to commission when making larger workpieces but will often make smaller scale products for direct retail or supply wholesale to shops and galleries. &amp;nbsp;The larger work will often involve the need for site installation. &amp;nbsp;Many blacksmiths fit their own work on site such as gates and railings, which often involves working with other craftspeople and professionals.&amp;nbsp; Site work can involve working in locations such as sensitive historical sites (when undertaking conservation for heritage organisations or private clients), large corporate developments (when fitting a public art piece) or a private home (when fitting a front gate). &amp;nbsp;Blacksmiths have to work within legislation and regulation, managing issues such as health and safety, environmental concerns, building construction&amp;nbsp; and listing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Blacksmith skills cover a broad range and they may choose to concentrate on one particular aspect such as artistic, architectural, heritage or industrial.&amp;nbsp; As such, they will be expected to be aware of the context and relevant areas of their craft such as historical aesthetic and technical changes, as well as current methods, design movements, makers and technical advances. &amp;nbsp;Most blacksmithing businesses operate in the crafts sector rather than in large scale manufacturing and will consist of no more than one or two people including the employer. &amp;nbsp;Blacksmiths will often be expected to work as a member of a close-knit team, usually directly with their employer and other staff. &amp;nbsp;After a period of gaining experience and the trust of their employer, they will occasionally be required to work without direct supervision, perhaps for a day at a time when, for example, their employer has to be away from the forge on a client visit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, skills and behaviours for blacksmithing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and safety (H&amp;amp;S)&lt;/strong&gt; - health and safety process, legislation and regulations in the forge and on site including COSHH, H&amp;amp;S at work act 1974.&amp;nbsp; Knowledge of safe work processes that ensures the safety of self and others such as personal health surveillance, hazard recognition, risk assessment, method statements, disposal of waste, equipment inspection, personal protective equipment.&amp;nbsp; Knowledge of exposure, risk and prevention of flash burns, arc eye, radiant heat, noise exposure and fumes as well as knowledge of preventing musculoskeletal and manual handling injuries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials -&lt;/strong&gt; the properties and uses of materials used for blacksmithing such as the effects of heat and working on forgeable metals. &amp;nbsp;The effects of combining metals and other media such as wood, stone or plastic. &amp;nbsp;Modes of supply, methods for handling and storing resources.&amp;nbsp; The effects of the environment and techniques for protecting metalwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; - the key equipment, fixed and hand tools, the principles of operation, manufacture, set up, maintenance and safe use. &amp;nbsp;Hand tools such as tongs, punches, chisels, hammers, anvil tools and jigs.&amp;nbsp; Hand held machine tools such as drills and grinders. &amp;nbsp;Fixed forge equipment such as power hammers, presses, forges, furnaces. &amp;nbsp;Fixed fabrication equipment such as guillotines, rolls, metalworkers and linishers. &amp;nbsp;Fixed welding equipment such as welding plant, profile cutters and extraction systems. Fixed machine equipment such as drills, lathes, milling and grinding machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality - &lt;/strong&gt;knowledge of quality standards including those expected by the client, employer, suppliers and regulatory bodies, including methods of recording work, use of product data sheets, International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) 9001, Conformete European (CE) marking and building regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A blacksmith is someone who uses their craft, art or skill to design, shape and join metal components by hot forging and other metal working processes for small batch or bespoke production and/or heritage metalwork conservation. The job may involve the production of large or small-scale work ranging from architectural ironwork such as public art sculptures, gates and railings, to domestic decorative and functional objects such as furniture, fireplace tools, and mirror frames. Also produced are tools for themselves and other crafts such as tongs for the forge, wood turning tools for the local carpenter as well as industrial tools such as spanners or forged components for delivery to a factory as part of a production line. They will be using forged metals (mainly ferrous) often combined with other mixed media sometimes working in collaboration with other crafts persons. Blacksmiths most commonly work to commission when making larger workpieces but will often make smaller scale products for direct retail or supply wholesale to shops and galleries. The larger work will often involve the need for site installation. Many blacksmiths fit their own work on site such as gates and railings, which often involves working with other craftspeople and professionals. Site work can involve working in locations such as sensitive historical sites (when undertaking conservation for heritage organisations or private clients), large corporate developments (when fitting a public art piece) or a private home (when fitting a front gate). Blacksmiths have to work within legislation and regulation, managing issues such as health and safety, environmental concerns, building construction and listing requirements. Blacksmith skills cover a broad range and they may choose to concentrate on one particular aspect such as artistic, architectural, heritage or industrial. As such, they will be expected to be aware of the context and relevant areas of their craft such as historical aesthetic and technical changes, as well as current methods, design movements, makers and technical advances. Most blacksmithing businesses operate in the crafts sector rather than in large scale manufacturing and will consist of no more than one or two people including the employer. Blacksmiths will often be expected to work as a member of a close-knit team, usually directly with their employer and other staff. After a period of gaining experience and the trust of their employer, they will occasionally be required to work without direct supervision, perhaps for a day at a time when, for example, their employer has to be away from the forge on a client visit.&lt;/p&gt;",
