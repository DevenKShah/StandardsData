  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide range of sectors and environments. Typical settings can require the discovery, development and utilisation of natural resources, environmental protection or consideration of the built environment. Geoscientists work onshore and/ or offshore. They typically work for local authorities, government organisations, environmental consultancies, mining, quarrying, energy resources, water industry, multidisciplinary consultancies, ground investigation/engineering contractors and consultancies. Geoscientists may conduct their activities in an office, a laboratory, in the field or on site.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to guide sustainable development and stewardship of the natural and built environment. Geoscientists evaluate earth systems and advise on the viable exploration, management, development, remediation, and storage of earth resources. This advice may relate to, minerals, water, aggregates, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and radioactive waste, housing development or infrastructure alignment. Geoscientists also advise on the mitigation and management of geohazards (for example, flooding, coastal erosion, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides), the energy transition and alternative forms of energy that underpin the route to net zero carbon and sustainability. They may use engineering geology and geotechnical engineering approaches in activities that include land restoration, site investigations, geohazard assessment, waste disposal and the development of civil engineering infrastructure or construction activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Geoscientists investigate past climates to understand climate change and its impact on the environment and society. They manage and communicate potential risks and opportunities, with an awareness that the application of their expertise should be considered within a wider socioeconomic and environmental context. Geoscientists gather and analyse evidence to develop predictive models that assist resilience planning and safe development across a range of sectors. Data can be collected from examination of the ground surface, examination of past records (such as mapping and academic research), sub-surface investigation (for example, by drilling, probing and geophysical methods) followed by monitoring, examination and laboratory testing on the samples obtained. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal and external stakeholders at all levels. They are likely to deal with specialists such as scientists, engineers, other professionals, as well as project managers and society at large. Typical activities range from visiting sites to collect geological information, looking at the consistency of information collected to find anomalies and trends, for example, ore concentrations, soft ground, or contamination. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working on projects in areas such as resource management, environmental conservation and sustainability, renewable energy, water management, and the natural and built environment. Geoscientists are responsible for conducting scientific investigations of the geological materials, processes and products of the past and present. They interpret data to assess risk, identify potential opportunities and influence and advise on present day decisions. This can inform policy direction and adaptation strategies for a changing climate. They are versed in the commercial, contractual, and legal aspect of the projects they support and manage, and they work in accordance with their employer’s processes, procedures and relevant professional and ethical standards. Geoscientists are likely to report to a senior geoscientist, manager, project managers, clients, or shareholders. They can be specialists within a business or work independently on a consultancy basis. Geoscientists will have a high level of autonomy and identify what balance of work is required for each project.&lt;/p&gt;",
