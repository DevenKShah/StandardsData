  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of a retailer is to assist customers when they purchase products and services, which requires a good understanding of the stock being sold, the variety of ways customers can shop and the ability to process payments, for example, using a till. Retailers must be passionate about delivering a quality service that always aims to exceed customers’ expectations. Therefore, retailers enjoy direct contact with a wide range of people and are motivated by completing a sale and knowing a customer is happy with their purchase. They can work in a variety of shops and other retail establishments: small boutiques, large high street chains, supermarkets and well-known department stores are just some examples. More specialist retailers include funeral services, garden centres, delicatessens and people who work in remote environments for example in telephone, on-line and mail order retail. Regardless of the type of products and services being sold, a wide representation of employers from across the retail industry have defined this standard and agreed that the knowledge, skills and behaviours that apprentices must have to do their job are the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations of all sizes within the retail and tourism sector such as food, fashion, furniture, and automotive. Retail outlets range from traditional high street shops to larger organisations such as supermarkets and department stores. It is found in multi-national employers, small independent employers, and employers who trade through a variety of channels for example face to face, telephone, on-line and mail order retail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to advise on and sell products and services in a customer-centric retail environment. This includes creating an accessible and well-presented environment. Retailers provide information and advice to customers regarding stock, products, different ways customers can shop and various payment methods.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Retailers work flexible hours and shifts such as evenings, nights, and weekends. Face to face or instore roles may involve moving and replenishing stock, using relevant equipment such as pallet truck, steps, and trolley.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal stakeholders such as members of their own team, other departments, and senior management. They also interact with external stakeholders such as customers, delivery drivers and compliance officers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for maintaining business standards; ensuring stock is presented, replenished and available for the customer to purchase. Retailers will contribute towards the commerciality of the business by achieving targets, including sales and customer service, and following stock control in line with business objectives. They need to know the services they are selling to be able to build customer confidence in their business.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Retailers work to meet or exceed customer expectations and experience and will identify specific needs of individual customers. They will respond to customer enquiries complying with both business and legal requirements. They will have a knowledge of sustainability in relation to products such as dealing with excess packaging, waste and product sourcing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Retailers who work within smaller retail sites may have additional responsibilities such as where the stock is placed in store and planning the order of tasks.&#160; Retailers may be responsible for supporting the development of new colleagues through buddying or 1 to 1 coaching. Retailers typically work as part of a wider team, depending on the size of the organisation, reporting to a line manager or small shop owner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
