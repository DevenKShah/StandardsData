They can then continue to develop in that option (perhaps through a further apprenticeship), or broaden their HR expertise in another area to develop their career. Separately, there are a range of qualifications available for further study up to post graduate level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 5 apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years or when significant change is required.&lt;/p&gt;",
