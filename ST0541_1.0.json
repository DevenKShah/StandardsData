  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt;&#160; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A pattern cutter working within the clothing and textiles industry can be employed by a large, medium, small or micro size business, producing a variety of products from clothing and fashion items to leather goods, soft furnishings, marine and medical textiles. The role of a pattern cutter involves interpreting a product design brief and drafting patterns that reflect the design and technical specifications. They can use various pattern cutting methods to create the patterns such as, adjusting and shaping a standard pattern ‘block’, modifying a non-standard pattern base taken from the company library, or creating a pattern using ‘modelling’, which involves draping and pinning fabric over a mannequin and hand-cutting the fabric to form the pattern base.&#160; Pattern production software packages are also commonly used to create sewn product patterns, though in smaller businesses pattern cutters still produce patterns manually or use a combination of both manual and computerised systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Initially, a pattern cutter will work autonomously drafting the prototype pattern. They will work closely with a sample machinist to produce a made-up sample of the design, using the prototype pattern. They will then work as part of the production team to review the sample.&#160; The team involved will depend on the size of the company and may include designers, garment technologists and sample machinists. The team will analyse the sample and discuss and agree any changes required. The pattern cutter will then make adjustments to the pattern and produce the master pattern to be used in production, incorporating technical data such as balance marks, notches, seam allowance, grain lines, cutting instructions, size and component name. The role of a pattern cutter typically includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interpret given sewn product design briefs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drafting prototype patterns that meet specifications and reflect given designs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with the sample machinist to produce product samples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reviewing and assessing the product samples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adjusting prototype patterns to meet required design and fit specifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating the final master pattern ready for production&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supporting the cutting and production process&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge: A Pattern Cutter has knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain and customer base:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Different customer requirements e.g. quality standards, product finish, timescale&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The supply chain relevant to the manufacture of sewn products&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The input and output of goods and services relevant to production e.g. delivery timescales, lead times, production deadlines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials used in production:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The properties and construction of fabric and materials e.g. woven, knitted, non woven&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The behaviour and characteristics of materials used to produce sewn products e.g. stretchy, slippery, stiff, dense, shrinkage, fabric weight, drape, print, finish&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Quality assurance procedures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specifications relevant the production of clothing and sewn products e.g. seam allowances, tolerances, hem depths&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quality standards and specifications relevant to the production of sewn products e.g. seam types, stitch types, tolerances, product finish&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pattern fault diagnosis and rectification procedures e.g. poor fit, sizing, mismatched seams, incorrect markings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quality approval systems and control processes e.g. Inspection of samples, materials and products against specifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working Practices:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clothing or sewn product design briefs evaluation inform pattern production&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drafting standard block patterns&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adapting block patterns to reflect given clothing or sewn product designs briefs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pattern construction techniques e.g. drafting, measuring and marking&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Standard and international sizing relevant to the item in production e.g. ladies wear, children’s wear, tent diameters, car seat dimensions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Measuring techniques relevant to the product e.g. critical measurement points, girth measurement, length and breadth measurements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Calculations relevant to the production of clothing or sewn products e.g. ease, hems, seam allowance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of grading e.g. grading
