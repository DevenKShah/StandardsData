  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Gas Network Team Leader: Level 2&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The main role of a Gas Network Distribution Team Leader is to safely build, maintain and repair the UK’s gas network infrastructure to provide a reliable supply of gas to domestic, commercial and industrial users. There are two job roles within this occupation: ‘team leader service laying’ and ‘team leading main laying’. The&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;roles require work in all weather conditions at many sites across each company’s network, using a range of tools and equipment to install new mains or services and repair the existing asset infrastructure. Team Leaders are trained to develop a disciplined approach to work safely on a wide range of gas related equipment and to decide on the approach to be taken to complete work, within given instructions, by the team. The team for operational safety reasons is usually made up of two or, on occasion, three people. In addition to the high level of specialist skills required each Team Leader will need to demonstrate industry specific knowledge, including relevant legislation, safety procedures and protection of the environment. The apprenticeship is graded at Pass and Distinction and the final grade will be dependent on performance at the end of programme assessment. For both roles included in this apprenticeship, the duration is expected to be between 12 and 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ualification Pre-Requisites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While employers preference is for candidates to have achieved at least three GCSEs at grade A to C to include mathematics and English, this criteria may be overridden by employers where a compelling candidate applies without this. To ensure that all apprentices may achieve the required outcome levels in these subjects at completion of the apprenticeship, assessments in these subjects are incorporated as a core requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ore Requirements (Both Roles): Technical Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Installation, testing, purging and commissioning procedures needed to install assets, equipment, network infrastructure leaving them in an operational condition&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Legislation and Codes of Practice involved in the practical installation and maintenance of gas network assets&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Current industry health and safety standards and regulations, and environmental and regulatory requirements&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Practices, processes and procedures associated with gas network systems, controls and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant level of theory and principles that underpin the design and function of assets, components and associated systems and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Principles and processes that underpin the location and repair of network infrastructure assets&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Company policies, procedures and engineering instructions as defined by the employer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Determine the approach, within the instruction, to be adopted by the team to achieve objectives&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ore Requirements (Both Roles): Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake and document risk assessments&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Comply with workplace health, safety &amp;amp;
