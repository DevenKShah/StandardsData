Measurement underpins the UK economy and international trade. Each year in the UK over&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#163;600 billion worth of goods and utilities are sold based on the measurement of their quantity and quality. Metrology takes place across a wide range of industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, construction, energy, environment, pharma and healthcare and space and within all sizes of organisation. Important measurement activities can range from measuring galaxies to graphene, molecules, chemical pollutants, hip joints, aircraft, industrial emissions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This important work is carried out by skilled Metrology Technicians who understand core measurement principles and practices and whose role is to interpret and apply these whilst carrying out measurement activities in whichever industry they work. They are also able to identify measurement needs and plan and perform measurement tasks using tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs. Metrology is vital to improve the quality and throughput of goods and utilities, which in turn is essential to increasing productivity and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology Technicians must comply with statutory regulations and health and safety requirements. They will be able to carry out work with minimal supervision, take responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake, and will have a high level of attention to detail. The successful apprentice will become a valuable measurement specialist, within their organisation, significantly contributing to the future of the Metrology industry and the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job toles may include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Technicians associated with Measurement research;

Most candidates will be expected to have achieved grade C or above at GCSE level in English and maths and a relevant science subject, or equivalent prior to the commencement of the apprenticeship. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 in English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Professional registration&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard meets the requirements of Registered Engineering Technician (EngTech) and Registered Science Technician (RSciTech). The apprentice will be eligible for registration of EngTech and/or RSciTech on completion of the Apprenticeship. Upon receipt of the apprenticeship certificate, individuals are eligible to apply for &lt;span&gt;RSciTech&lt;/span&gt; through a shortened application route. Individuals also need to be a member of a professional body that is licensed by the Science Council to be awarded this status.
