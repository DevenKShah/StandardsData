  "standardInformation": "&lt;h2&gt;OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The construction sector is the driving force behind the UK economy, employing three million people and contributing 6.4% of GDP. Not only that, the construction industry is central to delivering the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure our society demands. A career in the construction industry is like no other. Bricklaying is a core function within the construction sector, particularly the house building sector. The Government has a target to build significantly more new homes over the coming years and therefore the demand for bricklayers has never been higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bricklayers lay bricks, blocks and other types of building components in mortar to construct and repair walls, foundations, partitions, arches and other structures eg chimney stacks. They might also refurbish brickwork and masonry on restoration projects. The range of sites and projects that bricklayers will work on include large commercial developments, new builds in housing, alterations, extensions and restorations. A bricklayer may work one-on-one or on larger jobs where their bricklaying group (gang) may work on a particular section of a building alongside other bricklaying gangs as well as other trades.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;CORE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS AND BEHAVIOUR REQUIREMENTS&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health and safety: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Health and safety hazards, current regulations and legislation including COSHH/risk assessments and understanding the importance of method statements.
