  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in forestry and land management. This includes governmental, non-governmental, private, public, charitable and local authority organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that have an interest in forestry and woodland creation and management. Landowning organisations or private estates may employ their own forest craftsperson(s) and or use contractors who employ forest craftspersons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out the practical operations required to create, maintain and harvest forests and woodlands. Most employers will specialise in either establishment and maintenance, or harvesting. Employees in both sub-sectors would be expected to be aware of the full range of forestry operations, and to understand the commercial, environmental and social impacts of forestry. Establishment and maintenance operatives will carry out the range of duties required to prepare the ground, plant trees and undertake ongoing maintenance, including weeding, beating up and pruning. Harvesting operatives will carry out the range of duties required to fell, process and extract trees and timber. This occupation works predominantly in either established forests, woodlands or on open land. They need to be able and willing to do practical work outdoors in all weathers. Forestry and woodland sites are often in remote locations and the ability to travel independently to access sites is advantageous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues including land owners, team leaders or work supervisors, and forest craftspersons. They may need to communicate with members of the public and other land management operatives in the course of their work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for initiating and completing their own work to specification, with minimal supervision, ensuring they meet set deadlines. They are responsible for meeting quality requirements and working in accordance with legislation, environmental, health, safety and welfare considerations. They are accountable for the health and safety of themselves and others. They are expected to exercise responsibility, autonomy and judgement within limited parameters. They perform tasks that are complex and non-routine and may be in a variety of contexts. Forest operatives are responsible for checking their tools, equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) are maintained and safe to use. They report to team leaders and or works supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;",

This is also a common requirement in contracts of service.As recognised most forest land owners will therefore require certificates of competence for workers before they award contracts. For example Forestry Commission (https://www.forestryengland.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/Pre%20commencement%20Meeting.pdf) require all contractors prior to commencing work to demonstrate that their staff have the relevant certificates of competence to the work site.  These include specifically for chainsaw use, crosscut, maintenance, felling small trees, felling large trees and windblown trees, depending upon what types of trees are in the contract.  Not in the public domain is a more detailed list that includes first aid (+F) and a range of operator tickets.  This means that these certificates must be held to work on forestry commission sites (a significant part of the England forest estate) for the apprentice to be able to work on these contracts.  In addition, most insurers of forestry works will require that training and certification meet the FISA recommendations, again limiting opportunities for apprentices to work if they are not certificated. Users of professional products are required to hold a certificate showing they have sufficient knowledge of the subjects listed in Annex I of Guidance on the requirements of the Plant Protection Products (Sustainable Use) Regulations 2012 (https://www.hse.gov.uk/pesticides/using-pesticides/codes-of-practice/guidance-sustainable-use-ppp-regs-2012.htm).
