  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation: Event Assistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An Event Assistant is an entry level position, typically working within a team of people in an events company or within the events department of a larger organisation. The role would usually provide support to a number of Event Planners or Project Managers by carrying out a diverse range of tasks necessary to plan, organise and deliver an event: for example, searching for the right location and venue for the event; working with the design team on the look and feel of the event; or organising logistics like transportation and catering. The events organised may be for the company where the Event Assistant is working, or could be for a variety of different clients including large corporations, smaller companies and not- for-profit organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Events cover a broad range of activities as well as sizes, from small numbers of attendees through to thousands. &#160;Around 75% of events are conferences, meetings, trade shows and exhibitions. Other events include outdoor events, cultural events, sporting and music events. &#160;Companies use events to bring together different groups of people: from employees attending a sales conference; to customers or suppliers attending the launch of a new product; to shareholders gathering at a conference designed to attract new investors. These are just a few examples – the breadth and diversity of the events industry is partly what makes it such an exciting place to work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As well as holding events in the UK, events agencies and events departments organise events in different countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set their own selection criteria. &#160;This will typically include a minimum of Level 2 Maths and English. Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Anyone, from any background, can have a successful career in event management if they have the right attitude, passion, stamina and commitment to learning. Previous experience is not typically needed. &#160;It is a demanding yet very rewarding environment to work in.&#160; &#160;Flexible, calm and proactive individuals with energy, enthusiasm, good communication skills, patience and an ability to empathise are ideal candidates for the events profession.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;An Event Assistant has the following skills, knowledge and understanding&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 1335px;&quot;
