  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Bus and Coach Technician will predominantly inspect, diagnose, repair and test equipment and systems on buses and coaches from different manufacturers.&#160; &#160;At the point of recruitment a specific trade would be selected, i.e. mechanical, electrical coachbuilder or mechelec (a combination of mechanical and electrical). Engineering technicians work on all systems of the vehicles in respect of their specific trade. The work ranges from performing simple tasks, like replacing a part to solving complex faults often using diagnostic equipment. &#160;The tasks faced by a technician are constantly changing as vehicles become more complex with the introduction of new technologies and differing fuel types. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The technicians of today have to demonstrate expertise in the technical side of their role as well as having strong problem solving skills. They must be able to work independently and also as part of a team. The growing complexity of the vehicles and the need to understand and comply with the rigorous Health and Safety and Legislative requirements, requires the Bus and Coach sector to attract and train high calibre individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Du&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ration of apprenticeship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is expected that it will take three to four years for the apprentice to attain the required level of competence in the workplace although it may be sooner if an individual already has significant training and practical experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set their own selection criteria for applicants. &#160;It is recommended that to optimise chances of selection, &#160;candidates &#160;demonstrate an interest in how the Bus and Coach Industry operates as well as an ability to work in an organised and methodical way to analyse and solve problems; be able to demonstrate mechanical skills; also demonstrate an ability to communicate both orally and in writing. &#160;Apprentices who are recruited without level 2 English and Maths will need to achieve this level prior to completion of their Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bus and coach engineering technician will demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to inspect, diagnose and record defects to the applicable standard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic principles based on logical, analytical interpretation leading to solving problems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Emerging bus and coach technologies and the impact they will have on the knowledge and skills technicians will require in the future&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Current Health and Safety requirements and workshop practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to carry out high quality &#160;road worthiness inspections specific to their trade&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How the business works from an operational perspective and where their role fits within the business and how they contribute to the success of the organisation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customer expectations delivering a safe, clean, reliable service&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The requirements of attending and assessing roadside incidents&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core skills&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out the foundation tasks common to all procedures involving basic mechanical and electrical and coachbuilder procedures including: the safe use of hand tools and workshop equipment; safe use of power tools and equipment; the use of mechanical and electronic measuring equipment; test equipment and gauges; basic workshop practices and procedures relating to working on vehicles and components; assembly processes for mechanical units, electrical circuits and coachbuilding, including various fixing and joining methods.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inspect and prepare a vehicle to the required company and DVSA standards to successfully pass the elements of mandated, pre-arranged vehicle tests specific to their trade&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the maintenance of a safe and efficient workshop and adhere to company and legislative processes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use current and emerging technology to access specific relevant information held within engineering manuals, drawings and electronic resources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out planned preventative maintenance and repairs within chosen trade&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remove repair/replace components in line with manufacturers and company procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Investigate defects reported by drivers and identify the root cause and eliminate recurring defects, relevant to chosen trade&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain records to company and Operators Licence obligations and regulations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bus and coach engineering technician will select ONE from the following FOUR trade specific roles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Mechanical&#160;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;Electrical&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the fundamentals of existing and emerging mechanical vehicle design and systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the fundamentals of existing and emerging electrical design and systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out routine mechanical servicing, planned preventative maintenance and “health checks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out routine electrical servicing and planned maintenance .
