  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Transport planning technicians provide technical support to professional transport planners in the preparation, assessment and implementation of policies, plans and projects to manage and improve local, regional, national and international transport systems, services and their connections with land use planning to support economic growth, protect the environment and support social cohesion. All Transport Planning Technicians will have a broad skills base, however, it is likely that some technicians may specialise in a particular element. This breadth of skills reflects that of professional transport planners, who come from a wide variety of backgrounds including mathematics, engineering and the social sciences. Transport planning technicians work both for public sector authorities and private sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A transport planning technician&#39;s work could involve contributing to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the planning and design of transport and traffic policies, plans, schemes and systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;collecting, preparing and presenting data, written information and analyses to inform the development of policies, plans and projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;modelling transport and traffic systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;assessing the impacts of possible transport measures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the development and implementation of travel planning (Smart Travel) schemes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the successful delivery of projects working as a member of a team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeships. Apprenticeship candidates will typically have at least 5 GCSEs at Grades A*- C including English and Mathematics or their equivalent. Employers who recruit candidates without English or Mathematics at Grade C or above must ensure that the candidate achieves a level 2 equivalent standard prior to the completion of the Apprenticeship. Entrants must also show an aptitude and desire to work in transport planning and have a passion for helping develop creative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 36 months but this will depend on the previous experience of the apprentice and access to opportunities to gain the full range of competence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Apprenticeship. On completion of the apprenticeship the apprentice will have satisfied the requirements for registration as an Engineering Technician by the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation. The apprenticeship is also mapped to the Transport Planning Societyâ€™s Professional Development requirements offering young people the opportunity to access a work-based route to a career as a professional transport planner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transport Planning Technician, on completion of the apprenticeship, needs to know about&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he policy, legal and regulatory context &lt;/strong&gt;within which transport planners work including national, regional and local policies; health and safety, environmental and transport regulations and planning acts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he collection and analysis of data, &lt;/strong&gt;including new data obtained through transport and traffic fieldwork as well as the identification and use of existing sources.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ansport and traffic models, forecasting &lt;/strong&gt;and the principal analytical methods and software packages in general use including model specification, calibration and application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he assessment of transport and traffic policies, plans and projects &lt;/strong&gt;conforming with formal requirements, design principles and standards and best practice.
