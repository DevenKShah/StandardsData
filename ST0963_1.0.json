  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering and manufacturing sector within the marine, aviation and automotive industries. Surface finishers may work for boat manufacturers, refit and repair boatyards, marinas, specialist marine companies, aerospace manufacturing, repair and restoration companies and automotive manufacturers including ‘supercar’ manufacturers and motorsport companies. These can be small, medium or large businesses. Surface finishers can undertake work on a variety of products including for example motorised cruisers, narrowboats, sailing boats, work boats, superyachts, high end vehicles, supercars, private jets and commercial aircraft. This is a core and options apprenticeship standard. Apprentices will be trained and assessed against the core and one option. There are three options: 1. Marine surface finisher 2. Aviation surface finisher 3. Automotive surface finisher &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is for surface finishers to prepare the wooden (hard and soft woods), metal (ferrous and non-ferrous) or composite (FRP, FRC) hulls, superstructures, chassis and components of boats, vehicles and aircrafts of varying complexity and size. They plan their work, set up equipment and apply coatings to the prepared surface using specialist techniques and products for example, spray, hand paint, varnish and French polish. They identify paint defects, take corrective action, carry out performance testing and quality assurance activities including the use of inspection equipment. They carry out maintenance activities on facilities and equipment and complete a wide range of documentation. The main differences between the three options are those relating to dimensional scale, volume of throughput, operational environment, materials (automotive uses water-based paints, marine uses a lot of varnishes and aerospace uses more complex substrates subject to regulatory oversight), technology, equipment and application technique. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the immediate team such as production staff, quality assurance staff and specialist trades such as engineers, boat builders, riggers, carpenters, welders and electricians. They also liaise with other departments regularly, such as sales, health and safety, human resources, audit and training. Surface finishers may also have contact with external technical paint representatives, contractors, customers and suppliers. Surface finishers work in paint preparation workshops, finishing spray booths, tented areas, product interiors and other outside environments. These areas house a range of specialist tools and equipment, which could include a maintenance area, mixing area and adjoining workshops. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring the highest standards are met when preparing a product or coating to the appropriate final surface finish. They must ensure the safety of themselves and others and the environment ensuring they utilise Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), carry out occupational health surveillance and adhere to Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH). They may work on their own or part of a team. They must work within budgets, timescales and quality standards to meet customer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;",
