  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This Lightning Protection Operative occupation is found in the construction, facilities management, heritage, infrastructure, transportation, utilities, petrochemical and energy production/distribution sectors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to install and/or maintain lightning protection and earthing systems to buildings and infrastructure to minimise damage to structures and their contents and to reduce the risk of injury to people in, or working on, the equipment that is being protected. The core element of an operative’s work is the installation of lightning protection systems but most will also undertake some power earthing work to provide a safe earth for electrical systems. This is a growing element of employers’ activities and some operatives will specialise in power earthing duties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal stakeholders such as company project managers, supervisors and safety representatives; and external stakeholders such as contractors, site management and safety teams, clients representatives, materials and equipment suppliers and training providers. The work is typically undertaken on construction sites or on client-owned premises or equipment and usually involves working on the outside of building structures on the roof or walls, or on equipment that is open to the atmosphere. It is an occupation that is often conducted outside in all weathers and at height. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation typically works in small teams overseen by a senior operative or supervisor. They will be required to complete basic tasks, such as product installation, routine testing and maintenance, without supervision and make accurate records of work undertaken. They will also be required to assist with more complex tasks, such as specialist testing, with the support of their team and under direct supervision.&lt;/p&gt;",
