  "entryRequirements": "&lt;p&gt;What are the typical entry requirements for becoming a Professional Advisor? These are quite variable as there are many routes - for example:-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the most frequent entry level route is for students who have completed an agriculture related further education course (HNC, HND or BSc) and would then pursue their professional qualifications on route to becoming a proficient and experienced Professional Advisor. This type of candidate (usually in their 20’s) may have greater levels of academic ability but may have less hands-on and practical experience as that part of their skill-set is still developing. A key part of the Professional Advisor apprenticeship is to ensure their &quot;practitioner&quot; skills have been developed and refined and so they are confident and capable of providing agronomic advice across a broad range of crops.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;less common but regularly occurring is to employ someone with a wide range of arable and farming experience (possibly gained as a Farm manager and Assistant Farm Manager or Farm Foreman) and who has successfully taken education up to A-level and BTEC, who would be able to handle the next steps of professional qualifications that this role requires (i.e. the appropriate BASIS qualification), although they might not always have completed any further education at college or university level.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;an exceptional candidate who demonstrates great aptitude for the role yet does not have higher level education (but does possess English and Maths skills up to GCSE level) – an example would be an experienced Sprayer Operator who knows a great deal about the application and use of crop protection products, their effects and the consequences of use and wanted to change their career to take advantage of this knowledge and experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;having completed a form of higher education in a near-related area e.g. Geography or a Science but had pursued (usually under their own initiative) supportive qualifications and extensive vocational experience to fill the gaps in their skills, knowledge and experience (e.g. Foundation BASIS). They would then present as a very strong candidate who would be able to handle the challenge of completing all aspects of becoming a Professional Advisor.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in agriculture and horticulture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to consult with and provide technical advice to farmers and growers to help them support their crop husbandry, based on latest scientific thinking, environmental requirements and in line with legislation and policy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal colleagues, farmers and growers and a range of industry experts (including scientists, independent experts, research organisations and other advisers). A large proportion of the working day is spent on grower premises i.e. farms, nurseries, estates, glasshouses, of varying sizes and often outside in all weathers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing accurate research-informed advice. Advisers are accountable and expected to use their own initiative, working alone and with high levels of autonomy. Advisers could be expected to support a large group of growers and farmers (circa 40-100). In larger organisations an Adviser would typically report to Senior Management. Advisers may carry responsibilities for leadership and/or mentoring of new or developing members of staff. In some instances, Advisers would also carry the responsibility for resources such as their direct team personnel (which may encompass budget management) and activities for supporting staff such as: sharing knowledge and good practice, peer observations of grower and farmer crops and specialised precision farming developments.&lt;/p&gt;",
