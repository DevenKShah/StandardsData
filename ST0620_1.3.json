  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health and care sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation’s broad purpose is to provide excellent care to people diagnosed with cancer by delivering high quality and accurate radiotherapy, considering patients’ emotional, psychological, and physical needs through the stages of their cancer treatment when at times they may be extremely vulnerable. They are responsible for the individual from the time of referral for radiotherapy by a cancer specialist and will prepare radiotherapy patients for treatment, including scanning and planning the patients’ radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;external beam radiotherapy, a method for delivering a beam, or several beams, of high energy X-rays to cancer cells&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;brachytherapy, a form of radiotherapy where a sealed radiation source, eg in a needle or tube, is placed inside or next to cancer cells&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery which delivers multiple beams of focused radiation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;proton therapy, a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to deliver a radiation dose to cancer cells&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;superficial skin radiotherapy, which uses X-rays or electrons to deliver a radiation dose to cancer cells.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, a therapeutic radiographer interacts with cancer patients, , their carer(s), members of the public and a range of healthcare professionals e.g. physicists, dosimetrists, doctors, nurses and dietitians, in a variety of settings such as hospitals and hospices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A therapeutic radiographer is responsible for planning, checking and using imaging to deliver accurate radiotherapy in a compassionate and caring manner. As an autonomous practitioner, they are responsibility for the individual from the time of referral, through to aftercare and on-going support after radiotherapy. They are professionally and legally accountable for their actions and the actions of those who they are supervising.&lt;/p&gt;",
