  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a range of organisations, typically including charities, universities, pharmaceutical companies, breeders, contract research organisations and biotechnology research and development organisations. The nature of the work and species that are used will depend on the organisation, some work in very specific fields using only a few species others, whereas the universities, may be multispecies with a wide range of techniques and research fields. Animal technologists are likely to be laboratory based. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to carry out complex scientific procedures on laboratory animals. This occupation requires a high degree of technical skill and knowledge to ensure that techniques are carried out with a high degree of accuracy and precision, helping to ensure high standards of scientific research and that the welfare of the animals is considered at all times. Animal technologists are required to work with a range of scientific equipment in complex environments. They require a broad knowledge of science, animal anatomy and physiology, technical in-vivo scientific procedures, including aseptic techniques, animal welfare legislation and animal husbandry in order to practice effectively. They also require high levels of manual dexterity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of internal and external stakeholders. They are required to communicate effectively with their team and the wider research community (including researchers, Home Office Inspectors, named Veterinary Surgeons and named Animal Care and Welfare Officers). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for carrying out scientific procedures and tasks independently and in compliance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 (and other related animal welfare legislation, including the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006). They are required to plan, manage and carry out their own work on time and to the required quality, in accordance with work instructions. An Animal Technologist is likely to operate within a team and report to a supervisor/ line manager.&lt;/p&gt;",
