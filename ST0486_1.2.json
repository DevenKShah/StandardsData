  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in&#160;45 Fire Services across England as well as other organisations who have their own fire services such as the RAF, Airports, Ministry of Defence and those dealing with explosives and chemicals. Therefore, although the role is predominantly found in the public sector, there is a need for operational firefighters in the private sector. The size of the employer will vary but will tend to be medium to large in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to deal with a wide range of emergency situations where problem solving and initiative is vital to resolve incidents quickly and calmly. When in attendance, an Operational Firefighter must adopt a sensitive approach to dealing with members of the public and casualties who may be distressed and confused. These situations vary from tackling fires, searching, rescuing and protecting people and animals, by sustaining/preserving their life to protecting life and the environment from the effects of fire, natural and human disasters and hazardous materials. (Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives). They also respond to incidents involving planes, trains, road traffic collisions and marine emergencies. They may also conduct fire risk assessments and audits in businesses and homes, fitting detection and suppression equipment if necessary The working day could include theoretical and practical training along with testing and maintaining equipment to ensure operational preparedness. It is essential a firefighter is prepared and ready to respond at all times when on duty. Firefighters must be able to carry out physically demanding work; at height, in enclosed spaces, and outdoors - working in all weather and environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the community to provide information, advice and guidance to individuals and groups around health, safety and well-being. Firefighters work as part of a close-knit team of professionals that provides 24-hour response cover to resolve fire and rescue operational incidents. They adopt multi agency working principles with partners and other services to achieve a swift and successful conclusion. They will also need to be able to carry out tasks individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for all incidents in a professional manner and in alignment with operational command and procedures.They will need to be aware of all relevant legislation and apply where necessary&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
