  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the space sector, and specifically the &quot;upstream&quot; (manufacturing) area, which covers the design and production of satellites and the components and subsystems they comprise, along with production, operation and maintenance of highly specialised ground support equipment which does not fly in space but is used to support development and testing of satellites before launch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;BACKGROUND INFORMATION&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The upstream element of the industry is part of the overall space sector and is related to but distinct from the &quot;downstream&quot; part of the sector, which is concerned with the exploitation of data from satellites for end-user applications including weather forecasting and telecommunications. Income for the whole UK space sector has grown significantly and the upstream segment has been the majority contributor to the overall growth of the sector. This growth and the future predictions means there will be a significant increase in demand for these specialist skills to support the UK Space manufacturing sector. Space is a key part of the UKâ€™s Industrial Strategy supporting the development and increases in productivity of other key sectors (e.g. Agribusiness, Transport and Health, through improve data provision and communications). Government has committed funding to new developments supporting the upstream sector through investments to establish UK space ports, a satellite launch capability and an investment in the National Satellite Test Facility at Harwell. The broad purpose of the occupation is to support the development, manufacturing, assembly, integration and testing of complex, high value space hardware and ground-based equipment. For example, satellite mechanical structures, and subsystems for in-space power generation and distribution, spacecraft attitude control, thermal control, rocket propulsion, space communication, sensors, planetary landers, and associated support systems. Space technicians interpret drawings and specifications and formal procedures imposed by the employer and customers (for example Space Agencies) to plan and perform their work. They use sector specific techniques for many tasks, for example electronics board soldering, which is carried out using processes and standards developed specifically for space applications. They contribute to inspection and testing activities for mission-critical satellites and sub-assemblies, and support activities such as integration and testing of assemblies at space technology centres and launch sites overseas. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with line managers and supervisors, procurement officers, systems engineers, spacecraft subsystems experts, commercial and export managers, and the overall team working on a particular satellite or mission. They interact with customers (for example, space agencies and satellite operators) during site visits. Space technicians typically work in secure and controlled environments, workshops and development areas, as well as regular offices. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake within the limits of their personal authority. They adhere to statutory regulations and organisational health and safety requirements, and have an awareness of, and carry out work in compliance with, standards imposed by key customers (for example space agencies) and regulatory bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or The European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS).&lt;/p&gt;",

It will commence on 22 July 2024 and end when the apprentices identified in the dispensation request have completed their EPA, including any resits and retakes.For the apprentices identified in this dispensation who have failed to achieve a pass in one or more of the assessment methods, the usual six-month timescale requirement to retake the entire EPA has been removed, and only the assessment method(s) they have not achieved a pass in will be retaken.The end-point assessment organisation (EPAO) delivering the EPA for the apprentices will implement the dispensation as agreed by IfATE, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider (EQAP).\nA new, separate qualification is created.This will:- be titled ST0855 EAL Level 4 Space engineering technician (skills and behaviours)- contain only 2 assessment methods (the observation and interview assessment methods)- not contain the multiple-choice test- aggregate grades such that the observation and interview must be passed to achieve a pass overall; a distinction in either assessment method achieves a merit overall; and a distinction in both assessment methods achieves a distinction overall\nApprentices are still expected to have covered the full programme of study.",
