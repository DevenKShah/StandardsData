  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Wall and Floor Tilers operate in domestic and commercial properties undertaking all types of wall and floor tiling. Premises include houses, schools, offices, airports hospitals, factories and construction sites. The is varied work; tilers utilise and install a wide range of ceramic and natural stone tiles using different techniques. Tilers work both internally and externally; they work individually and/or as part of a team. They have a good knowledge of tiles, backgrounds and ancillary products and understand and comply with statutory, safety and environmental requirements. They are good problem solvers and communicators and are able to interact effectively with colleagues, clients and associated trades. The tiler must also be able to interpret drawings and be able to extract relevant information to the task in hand. The tiler must be able to recognise and achieve high levels of quality in their finished work.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORK&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASPECTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KNOWLEDGE &amp;amp; UNDERSTANDING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wall and Floor Tiler will know and understand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKILL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wall and Floor Tiler will be able to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The purpose, characteristics and application of materials, tools and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safe handling, storage and protection of materials and equipment and work area&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safe and efficient working methods and appropriate work requirements in accordance with Health and Safety legislation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Methods and techniques for the installation of porcelain, stone, conglomerate and mosaics in accordance with British Standards&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and minimise hazards and risks in the workplace, ensuring a safe environment is maintained at all times.

For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship English and maths minimum requirement is Entry level 3 and British Sign Language qualifications are an alternative to an English qualification for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration &lt;/strong&gt;: Typically 30-36 months. This timescale may reduce if an apprentice is part qualified on entry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date : &lt;/strong&gt;The Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
