Individuals in this role will use their HR expertise to provide and lead the delivery of HR solutions to business challenges, together with tailored advice to the business in a number of HR areas, typically to mid-level and senior managers. They could be in a generalist role, where they provide support across a range of HR areas – likely to be the Core HR option; or a specialist role, where they focus on and have in depth expertise in a specific area of HR – likely to be Resourcing, Total Reward, Organisation Development, or HR Operations. Whichever of these is chosen, they will have a good grounding across the whole range of HR disciplines as this is contained in both of the qualification options included in this standard. They will often be required to make decisions and recommendations on what the business can/should do in a specific situation.

Chartered membership can be achieved through further qualifications or experience based assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship could be an entry level role to the business, however, it is more likely to be a progression from a lower level role or apprenticeship, building on the knowledge and skills gained in that role or apprenticeship. On completion of this apprenticeship, the individual will be fully competent in the role and this will give them an in depth knowledge of HR in their chosen option. They can then continue to develop in that option (perhaps through a further apprenticeship), or broaden their HR expertise in another area to develop their career. Separately, there are a range of qualifications available for further study up to post graduate level.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 5 apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years or when significant change is required.&lt;/p&gt;",
