  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Railway engineering design technicians provide technical support to engineers who design infrastructure and systems for railways. The engineering disciplines involved include signalling, rolling stock, track, systems, civil engineering, communications, electrification and electrical plant. It is likely that many technicians will specialise in a particular discipline whist others will have a broader skills base.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A technician&#39;s work could involve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design - surveying a site, producing design drawings, assisting the development of technical solutions and production of calculations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analysis - use of software systems for data gathering, analysis and design.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning - helping to manage projects, set deadlines for the design of the project and working to a programme.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Site engineering â€“ taking responsibility for checking the progress and quality of specified technical aspects of construction work on site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key elements of the role include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contributing to design solutions by preparing calculations, producing engineering drawings and models.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supporting the administration and management of projects.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensuring outputs meet the required standards set by clients and the industry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working as a member of a team in both an office and on-site environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical Job titles:&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer, Site Surveyor and Railwayman&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeships. Apprenticeship candidates will typically have at least 5 GCSEs at Grades A*-C including Maths (Grade B), English and Science or their equivalent. Employers who recruit candidates without English or Maths at Grade C or above must ensure that the candidate achieves a level 2 equivalent standard prior to the completion of the Apprenticeship. Entrants must also show an aptitude and desire to work in the field of rail design, have a passion for developing technical solutions and demonstrate fitness to work in a commercial sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 36 months but this will depend on the previous experience of the apprentice and access to opportunities to gain full range of competence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Apprenticeship. On completion of the apprenticeship the apprentice will have satisfied the requirements for registration as an Engineering Technician by the relevant professional engineering institution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Railway Engineering Design Technician needs to know about&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he different techniques and methods used to design infrastructure, systems and equipment for use by rail transport systems. &lt;/strong&gt;This includes an understanding of how ideas and requirements are converted into engineering specifications and designs; knowing the industry codes, company standards/procedures, contracts and specifications and when to apply them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he appropriate scientific, technical and engineering principles relating to rail transport systems.&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;This includes an understanding of &#160;the mathematical, scientific and engineering techniques required to support the design process; an understanding of the fundamental principles in track, traction, signalling, rolling stock, civil engineering structures, mechanical and electrical equipment and plant design; and how these interface with each other.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to work effectively and contribute to engineering solutions by the correct use of resources and time&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes an understanding of project management systems, tools and techniques including change, document and configuration control procedures; the commercial, construction and technical constraints on a design; and the quality management and assurance systems as they are applied to the design process; and time management within overall programme of work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to communicate effectively using a range of techniques&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes an understanding of different communication methods and when to use them; the structure of technical reports and how to write them; technical drawing conventions and engineering terminology; collaboration platforms and effective team working.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he code of conduct of relevant professional bodies and institutions including ethics and their application in design&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes an understanding of the protection of client confidentiality and the need to adhere to corporate policies on ethics and diversity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;afe working practices and how to comply with them&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes hazard identification, mitigation and safe-by-design for rail systems; and an understanding of relevant health and safety legislation procedures and how they interact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ustainable development and their own contribution to economic, environmental and social wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes an understanding of company and client sustainability and environmental policies and their impact on design; and an awareness of Environmental Impact Assessment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ources of and approaches to Continuing Professional Development (CPD)&lt;/strong&gt;. This includes an understanding of appraisal schemes including training and development plans, CPD obligations and competency requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Railway Engineering Design Technician needs to be able to&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use appropriate scientific, technical and engineering principles, techniques and methods to contribute to the design of infrastructure, systems and equipment for the rail transport system&lt;/strong&gt;.
