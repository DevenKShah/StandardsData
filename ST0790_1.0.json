  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Energy and Power, Aerospace and Defence industries that are in the areas of Power and Propulsion (aviation) Engineering respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to design and develop, operate and maintain gas turbine systems. Power and Propulsion Gas Turbine Engineers apply their specialist skills in mechanical or aircraft propulsion engineering and strive to improve the reliability, efficiency and emissions of the engine they are working on. These engineers are highly skilled specialists with fundamental and applied knowledge of engineering related to the design, performance, operability and maintenance, and the selection of gas turbine engines. These cover the mechanical and aerodynamic design of its components/parts, turbomachinery, combustion, overall engine system thermodynamic performance, operational and control strategy, diagnostics and component life estimation. These highly skilled engineers are challenged with bringing together the conflicting requirements of operational or technical constraints that include engine reliability, efficiency and emissions, alongside the economic viability of operations. For example, achieving overall good efficiency at the expense of favourable reliability. The challenge may also include technological improvements that increase efficiency but not necessarily emissions, and in some cases achieving peak component efficiency but only for a narrow range of operation. These engineers also may oversee activities related to the upgrading of existing or future development, and cost analysis may be necessary to determine the feasibility of certain projects. They may also create automated workflow systems to reduce the costs of engineering in the future, and documentation of these activities is often necessary to improve efficiency. They may develop conceptual designs or diagnose faults in engine systems by applying gas turbines specific knowledge and operational experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with generalists and specialists (in the office and the field) of different aspects of engineering design and operations. He/she will typically refer to other specialists when additional separate expertise is required to generate a global outcome/solution. He/she will find themselves presenting their conclusions to technical, non-technical engineering experts or high-level management. Much of the work is office based, but Power and Propulsion Gas Turbine engineers are also present during the assembly of components to form the engine, the integration with the airframe, coupling with electric power generators and other mechanical driven equipment like gas compressors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the provision of services and solutions relating to in-service fleet support, lifecycle cost reduction, engine modifications and life extensions.They prepare, implement and monitor project plans, project risk registers, project priorities and formal deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are also responsible for monitoring and influencing the technical and schedule progress of project tasks, proactively identifying risks and issues, and recommending solutions. Research duties may be necessary to determine the best ways to construct or integrate systems and parts, and some work is done independently while collaboration is usually necessary. They will typically report to a Senior Principal Engineer, Senior Specialist or a Chief Engineer depending on the organizational structure while working with different levels of engineers across multiple engineering disciplines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Power and Propulsion Gas Turbine Engineer must have the core requirements below and demonstrate the specialist requirements in ONE of the following two job specific roles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aircraft Propulsion - Individuals in this role lead the design and testing of jet engine propulsion sub-systems (components or parts) and integration with other components of the engine system. The subsystems or parts include: intake, compressor, combustor and fuel system, turbine, nozzle etc. They are involved in the performance, control and maintenance of engines when in service to ensure reliability and emissions are in check. These engineers are also involved in evaluating the design implications of integrating engine systems with the airframe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rotating Machinery Applications – Individuals in this role lead in the technical and economic management of gas turbines in land and sea applications that are applicable to the energy industry (electric power and oil and gas mechanical drive applications). These engineers ensure that gas turbines operate reliably and economically through regular performance assessment, implementing well-timed maintenance measures, as well as predicting and identifying faults before they can lead to failures that cause loss of production. They will typically interact with the engine manufacturer to report problems and demand measures to optimise operations. When they work in an engine manufacturer company, they can be the interface with the gas turbine user and their design team. Their knowledge and experience are also required in the design and testing of existing and new gas turbine systems.&lt;/p&gt;",
