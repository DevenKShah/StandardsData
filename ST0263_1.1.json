  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment construction sector. The construction industry is central to creating the homes, schools, hospitals, energy and transport infrastructure society needs. There is growing demand for carpenters and joiners to help meet the need for new homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is working with building materials (most often wood) to create and install building components.&#160; This typically involves shaping and cutting materials, installing finished materials like partitions, doors, staircases, window frames, mouldings, timber floor coverings and erecting structural components such as floor joists and roofs. All work needs to be carried out safely, using the appropriate tools and to the quality specified.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation includes two different options and people will either work on a construction site as an Advanced Site Carpenter or in a workshop as an Advanced Architectural Joiner:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Site Carpenters work on building sites in the construction of domestic and commercial properties, preparing and installing complex and bespoke building components. They prepare, construct and erect irregular and complex roof structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Architectural Joiners are employed in a workshop producing complex building components by setting out, marking out and producing assembled components requiring advanced skilled work including the full range of woodworking machines. There will sometimes be a need for refurbishment/repair work of bespoke pieces. They have an in depth knowledge of a range of manufacturing components from a range of hardwoods and softwoods.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation liaises with other construction trades such as bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers, supervisors, site management, architects, designers, contractors and customers. An Advanced Site Carpenter would generally liaise with other trades such as bricklayers, plasterers and plumbers, site management and contractors. Advanced Architectural Joiners would liaise with other workshop colleagues as well as architects, designers and customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, sometimes supervising others, using machinery and tools to create or refurbish/repair structures or components from the designs, plans and specifications of architects and designers that meet the client’s expectations. Having attained this level, they will be competent to progress further in the industry as team leaders, trade forepersons, contract or works managers.&lt;/p&gt;",
