Broadcast and Media Communications Engineers are at the heart of the transmission process from the production studio through to the home screen/radio/streaming device. Job holders are not expected to technically operate or produce a TV/Radio programme, but they do ensure that content is broadcast and delivered on time and to the highest level of quality. They typically work for a broadcaster, broadcast or media services supplier or manufacturer. Clients or customers may be internal or external depending on the size of the employer; these could include production studios, production companies or those operating live events. They may be located in a broadcast or operations centre, at customer premises, or on outside broadcast locations such as sports events or in a field next to transmitters. The broadcasting and media communications industry is a 24/7, 365 days a year operation, with out of hours and irregular working. The role is a unique blend of electrical engineering, electronic engineering, software engineering and creative media. It’s a critical role in the industry and key areas for the Broadcast and Media Systems Engineer role include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Set up and design, or installation and build, of the broadcast and media technical system infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining infrastructure and identifying and resolving faults&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensuring reliability and integrity of broadcast and communication systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working to tight deadlines, to ensure services are always available to end users, and that the security and quality of the media content being delivered is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Service management and support for end-user companies, service providers, suppliers and larger manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will be a matter for individual employers, but typically entrants may be required to have a minimum of 2 A levels at Grade C or above; one of which should be in maths or a science, and 5 GCSEs at Grade 4 or above (or equivalent) including English, Maths and Science or suitable equivalents such as BTECs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of
