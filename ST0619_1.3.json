  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health and care sector and includes the NHS and private healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupationâ€™s broad purpose is to provide excellent care by obtaining images of a high diagnostic quality, using a range of high-cost and complex imaging equipment. This includes imaging using X-rays and cross-sectional imaging methods (Computed Tomography or CT), fluoroscopy and Interventional Radiology, and assisting in other imaging modalities, such as Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Breast Imaging and Nuclear Medicine. Diagnostic Radiographers work with a broad range of service users, including those with learning/cognitive and /or physical limitations, those in distress, children and the terminally ill. They work independently to assess, authorise, obtain consent and undertake individual examination requests for diagnostic radiography procedures. They evaluate images and determine appropriate actions. The work is physically and mentally demanding and involves direct contact with service users, which can be of a sensitive nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, a diagnostic radiographer interacts with service users, their carers, members of the public and other healthcare staff e.g. porters, nurses, other allied health professionals, doctors, external contractors, engineers and medical physicists etc. They primarily work in diagnostic imaging departments in hospitals, but also provide mobile imaging on wards, including the intensive care unit, neonatal unit, emergency department and operating theatres. Diagnostic radiographers may also provide imaging in stand-alone satellite units.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Diagnostic radiographers are responsible for safely using imaging equipment and conducting examinations, including protecting service users, themselves, staff and visitors from radiation. As registered autonomous practitioners, they are professionally and legally accountable for their own actions, and for those operating under their supervision, as they deliver safe and compassionate care. They may work independently or as part of a team, and they may refer to another healthcare professional for advice; however, this may not always be available at night in smaller organisations or in satellite departments. They are expected to contribute to a 24-hour, 7-day week imaging service, with varying shift patterns and on-call service and, on occasion, may be the sole provider of imaging services for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;",
