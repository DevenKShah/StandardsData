They install, maintain, fault find and repair marine engines, ancillary systems and equipment. They design and produce solutions to meet boat layouts, restrictions and engineering requirements, or produce boat engineering systems from engineering and technical drawings to specifications. Marine engineers work to fine tolerances using a variety of measuring equipment, machines and tools. They manufacture, assemble, strip, repair and re-build components. They are expected to work individually and in teams. They comply with organisational and statutory health &amp;amp; safety, sustainability requirements and can work with minimum supervision. Marine engineers are good communicators and problem solvers, they commission and test boat systems, are responsible for the quality and accuracy of their work and often attend sea trials. Marine engineers typically work with associated trades such as Boatbuilders and Marine Electricians and have a strong marine industry understanding. They are highly skilled and capable of adapting to changing demands as boats become more complex.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width:
