  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a variety of contexts, including the NHS, local authorities, voluntary, community, and social enterprise sector (VCS) organisations, the education and justice sectors and in independent practice.&#160; Speech and language therapists are regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council and are uniquely qualified to provide speech, language, communication and eating, drinking and swallowing therapies. They work in many settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, in the community, within charities, schools, and people&#39;s’ homes. There are opportunities throughout their career to specialise and move into leadership, training and research roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation&#39;s broad purpose is to apply evidence-based science to improve outcomes and quality of life for people with speech, language, communication needs (SLCN), voice, fluency, and/or eating, drinking and swallowing difficulties. Communication and eating and drinking difficulties can have a significant impact on someone’s life from birth to death. There is huge variety in roles; some speech and language therapists work with children to identify and develop their communication difficulties so they can reach their full potential, whereas others work with adults with conditions that affect their communication and/or swallowing, such as stroke, dementia or Parkinson’s, or support those with learning disabilities to communicate. Others might carry out research, work in specialist medical units, or provide advice on communication aids, for example, to children with cerebral palsy.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an speech and language therapist interacts with babies, infants, children, young people and adults. Speech and language therapists frequently work as part of a team, alongside other health, education and social care professionals, including nurses, Allied Health Professionals (AHPs), social workers, doctors, teachers and teaching assistants, educational and clinical psychologists, families/carers and volunteers. Speech and language therapists provide person-centred care, recognising and valuing the key contribution of the person and their family/carers in developing appropriate support&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The speech and language therapist will play a central role in the health, well-being and participation of people with a range of developmental, and/or acquired conditions which may include end of life care and learning disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Speech and language therapists are autonomous professionals, responsible and accountable for their actions. They are also responsible for ensuring their knowledge and skills remain current, through evidence-based practice and maintaining professional competence. The speech and language therapist will also play a role in supporting other people’s’ learning, including future entrants to the profession, demonstrate leadership qualities, and may manage and lead colleagues/services.&lt;/p&gt;",
