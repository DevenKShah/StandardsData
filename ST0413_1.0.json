  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare Science (HCS) Practitioners (HCSPs) fulfil a common occupational role &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt;. They work independently and as part of a team providing HCS scientific and technical services within HCS Divisions in Life Science, Physiological Science, or Physical Science, with the specific focus of work determined by the area/department within which they work &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They use expertise in applied scientific techniques to deliver patient sensitive and quality assured tests, investigations and procedures (in some cases, including specialist therapeutic interventions) on samples, patients and equipment. HCSPs are responsible for the analysis of a wide range of diagnostic tests that contribute to the clinical assessment of patients for the presence of disease, the monitoring of health and the effectiveness of treatments. While working to departmental protocols, HCSPs are required to use judgement, deal with ambiguity and supervise the training of those in the trainee practitioner and HCS support workforce. HCSPs work in a range of different settings including hospitals, primary care, public health, and private sector hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duties of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HCSPs will have the knowledge, skills, competences, attitudes, values and behaviours to perform complex clinical technical procedures within the scope of practice of their HCS specialism to a high degree of safety, accuracy and precision, recording and interpreting the clinical technical output as required. They must take responsibility and be accountable for their own practice in respect of the detailed diagnostic, technical and clinical outcomes of tests, procedures and analyses, as well as leading and supporting teams involved in these. They must be organised and prioritise work through good time management and achieve demanding tasks/objectives against deadlines. HCSPs must be able to support the development of and write delegated technical Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and have excellent oral/written and interpersonal communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rofessional recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All HCSPs are eligible for registration on the Academy for HCS accredited register (which is the HCS register recognised and supported by Health Education England [HEE]). Completion of the apprenticeship in the Life Sciences Division also confers eligibility to apply for statutory regulation with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as a Biomedical Scientist. In addition, those in the Physical Sciences Division are also eligible to join the accredited Register of Clinical Technologists (RCT) held by the Institute of Physics and Engineering Medicine (IPEM).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for appointing apprentices. Apprentices&amp;nbsp;will achieve an accredited/approved BSc (Honours) degree in healthcare science.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English and Maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the End-Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;6&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically, a minimum of 36 months but may be longer depending on the learner&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEHAVIOURS and VALUES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be compassionate;
