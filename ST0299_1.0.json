The dispensation will last until the revised EPA plan is published but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.\nThe key changes are: The duration of the simulated observation will be increased by 15 minutes. This is to allow apprentices working within an ‘aseptic unit’ only sufficient time to undertake the additional activities required in such settings.\n\u00A0; This apprenticeship standard is in the process of being revised. The revised version will reflect the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) Requirements for the education and training of pharmacy support staff, October 2020. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other occupational standards in revision are available in the revisions status report.",
