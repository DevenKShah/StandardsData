  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the role&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pest control refers to the regulation or management of a species known as a pest and which can be perceived to be detrimental to a person&#39;s health, the environment or the economy. A Pest Control Technician works within a wide range of industrial, commercial and domestic environments. Examples include, but are not limited to, manufacturing / warehouse sites, office buildings, retail premises, hotels / restaurants, hospitals schools and residential properties.

The main difference is that vertebrates (such as birds, mice, rats, foxes etc) have a backbone or spinal column whereas invertebrates (such as insects, beetles and moths) do not.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Pest Control Technician will need to use their knowledge of pest biology and behaviour to survey sites, identify levels of pest infestations, determine appropriate actions to eradicate pests and prevent re-infestation, ensuring at all times that current legislation is adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work typically includes routine proactive visits and one off reactive visits to solve immediate pest issues. They may work within a team or alone. They must operate in a safe manner, particularly when handling traps and chemicals and they should communicate with all types of customer to ensure that they are fully briefed about treatment programmes and any associated risks relating to treatment.
