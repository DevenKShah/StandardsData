  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Operating department practitioners are registered healthcare professionals specialising in caring for people of all ages before, during and after surgery. Operating department practitioners, therefore, mainly work in operating departments. They work alongside other professionals, such as doctors and nurses, and take a lead role in ensuring the service user is safe during each stage of the journey through the operating theatre. Operating department practitioners must continually make professional decisions to ensure the service user receives the best care. Operating department practitioners also ensure that the operating theatre environment is safe and effective and, therefore, have expertise in the management of specialist equipment and materials in a highly technical environment; for example, handling surgical instruments, checking anaesthetic equipment, moving individuals, and giving medication. Operating department practitioners must be confident, compassionate, competent and make effective judgements, for which they are accountable. They must use evidence-based practice to inform and evaluate the effectiveness of their actions with the aim of continually improving outcomes for service users. They are responsible for ensuring their own professional knowledge and skills through continuous professional development (CPD) and supporting the development of others. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anaesthesia phase of care requires operating department practitioners to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;provide individualised care prior to and throughout surgery or other procedures, including reassurance and support during vulnerable times&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;use a wide range of clinical skills knowledge and understanding to ensure a safe environment during the administration and maintenance of anaesthesia&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;position the individual to optimise surgical access&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;maintain the individuals safety and dignity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;medicines management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;prepare a wide range of specialist equipment and devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;assist the anaesthetist in safely securing and maintaining the individual’s airway and physiological stability during anaesthesia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery phase of care requires operating department practitioners to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work as part of a team to provide safe, individualised care during surgery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;take professional responsibility for selecting, preparing and providing the correct sterile surgical equipment to the surgeon, and being accountable for all surgical instruments, equipment and swabs throughout the procedure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;anticipate the surgical team’s requirements, responding appropriately and effectively.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;ensuring the correct management of clinical specimens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Post-anaesthetic care phase involves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;caring for the individual whilst in the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;observing and monitoring a patient’s vital signs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;maintaining their airway and identifying and responding to changes in the individuals physiological and psychological condition&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;providing appropriate treatment including pain control and post-operative nausea and vomiting care; until the service user has recovered from the immediate effects of anaesthesia and has been assessed in order to ensure they are fit to be discharged from PACU&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
