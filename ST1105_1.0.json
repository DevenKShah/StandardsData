  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the historic environment, construction, building conservation and cultural heritage sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure the maintenance of heritage properties through construction projects that repair, restore, adapt, alter or retrofit historic buildings and heritage assets, doing so according to their significance and performance. Historic buildings and heritage assets are generally considered to include whole buildings, parts of buildings, ancillary structures, monuments, and other architectural features such as garden structures, walls and paving that were built before 1919, or those that are built using traditional methods and materials, including structures protected by legislation such as Listed Buildings, Scheduled Ancient Monuments and those within Conservation Areas. Heritage Construction Specialists oversee work related to the fabric of a building or structure and its internal and external features and settings. They combine practical construction skills with their knowledge of traditional materials, practices and the way each building performs holistically, to inform the conservation and construction techniques they use when managing and leading on historic building projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;The Heritage Construction Specialist is typically site-based, including outdoor working, working at height, and working away from home, including rural and remote locations, but normal duties also include workshop operations, office working and attendance at meetings with stakeholders, clients or colleagues. They will typically need to be able to drive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An individual in this role might typically have a trade or profession, such as – but not exclusively – woodworker, bricklayer, stonemason, plasterer, metalworker or surveyor, and have specialist knowledge and experience of the requirements of working at heritage properties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of clients, colleagues and stakeholders in the public, private and third sectors, within organisations of any size. Heritage Construction Specialists might work alone or as a more senior member of a small team. They may oversee or coordinate other personnel or subcontractors and will sometimes work with other heritage professionals, such as a conservation officer or architect, to develop the detailed conservation solutions for adapting older buildings and structures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for assessing the condition of historic and traditional structures; understanding the significance and history of the buildings and structures they work on; conserving and enhancing the fabric of a building or structures according to its significance, performance characteristics and condition; integration of new systems (for example electrical, mechanical) into heritage buildings; creating recommendations and construction work plans, contributing to the costing and conducting of construction work to appropriate professional and conservation standards; liaising with specialist contractors, stakeholders and clients; documenting their work to appropriate conservation standards; communicating their work to the public. They need to be able to work alone or as part of a team, and make decisions about work plans for themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;",
