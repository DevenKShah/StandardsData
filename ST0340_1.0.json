  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Travel consultants have a highly responsible role as they provide outstanding customer service, delivering a range of often complex travel arrangements, accommodation bookings and ancillary services which help to ensure their travellers benefit from journeys and time at their destination that is positive and aims to exceed their expectations. Usually travel consultants specialise in either ‘corporate’ or ‘leisure’ travel but either way employers agree that their essential knowledge, skills and behaviours are transferable across the industry.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition of corporate and leisure travel consultants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 96px;&quot; width=&quot;96&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Corporate Travel Consultant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;367&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Corporate travel consultants typically work according to service level agreements, taking care of the unique needs of business travellers, and know how to tailor itineraries that ease their door&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;to door experience, taking account of factors that may impact on their trip including location and times, business facilities and corporate budgets. A key part of a corporate travel consultant’s role is appreciating that their customer must account for every single expense when travelling for business, and so must ensure travel time is organised and used as effectively as possible, and in compliance with the customer’s corporate policy or preferred choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 96px;&quot; width=&quot;96&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leisure Travel Consultant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;367&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Leisure travel consultants work in a fast paced, customer focused sales environment which aims to &#160;sell experiences and memories and meet the unique needs of leisure customers by sourcing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;and matching them to a variety of travel options within their budget including: tailor made itineraries, package holidays, special interest holidays, weddings abroad, cruises and seasonal activity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;based holidays. A key part of a leisure consultant’s role is keeping ahead of the ever increasing demand from customers for new and different leisure experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td
