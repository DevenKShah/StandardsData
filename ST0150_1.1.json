  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The engineer will install and service a range of domestic and/or commercial equipment from washing machines and micro-wave ovens in the kitchen, laundrette or restaurant to television and audio equipment in the living room. The influence of computers in controlling washing machines and providing television, have brought the installation and service requirements of these products together. In the near future, the ‘smart home’ will give wireless control of these products and link their requirements still closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To meet the needs of these ‘smart’ products, it is essential that the engineer is I.T. literate and has an understanding of all aspects of connectivity, with the ability to make and troubleshoot I.P. connections to routers, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, in both domestic and commercial situations. The engineer must also be capable in the usage of “Apps”. Technology is developing at a rapid rate and the range of products requiring the engineers skills will expand and require the engineer to maintain and update their knowledge and skills to meet these future needs. Many products will be integrated into the ‘smart home’ in the future and talk to each other through the “Internet of Things” giving the engineer a secure and profitable future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As most of the work is carried out in the customer’s home or business, the engineer has to be polite, well dressed and have appropriate customer facing skills. The work will be interesting and varied giving the opportunity to work with a wide range of people in differing environments. The engineer should have an enquiring mind and be able to follow a logical sequence of mechanical events or electrical tests. Following the Apprenticeship, the engineer will have additional training if they are working on gas appliances or working in specific commercial premises, they may also have the opportunity to take additional qualifications to further develop their skills and extend their prospects into management, training or development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic job titles recognised across the industry: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Installer.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the electrical products sector. Electrical, electronic product service and installation engineers may work for organisations of all sizes ranging from large multinational companies to small independent repair shops. Engineers usually work from home. They normally require a driving licence to enable them to drive safely to commercial or domestic premises in their given area. Engineers install, service or repair a range of electrical or electronic equipment, from washing machines and micro-wave ovens in the kitchen, laundrette or restaurant to television and audio equipment in the living room. Once the installation is complete, they demonstrate the product and provide information and advice on efficient operation and resource saving practices. &#39;Smart home technology&#39; means that the installation requirements of many appliances require the engineer to set up connectivity. For example using WiFi and bluetooth, enables products to communicate through the &#39;internet of things&#39; and be controlled with &#39;Apps&#39;. Engineers also repair and service electrical products for commercial or domestic customers. This involves testing equipment to find faults, carrying out repairs and replacing faulty parts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work the engineer comes into contact with customers. They represent their employer so providing high levels of customer service for all customers, including individuals in their homes, business owners and managers is an important part of the role. Engineers normally work alone with minimal supervision when out on a job and usually report to a senior engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for following health, safety and electrical installation and repair requirements and procedures. This minimises the risk of harm to themselves, customers, and their families, property and equipment. They must also deliver to customer service standards and timescales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An engineer is usually responsible for ensuring they carry the spare parts needed to complete their repairs. They must also keep their van and tools in good working condition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Following the apprenticeship, the engineer may complete additional training to enable them to work on gas appliances or work in specific commercial premises. They may also take additional qualifications to further develop their skills and progress into management, training or development.&lt;/p&gt;",
