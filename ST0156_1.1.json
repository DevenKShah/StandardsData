This involves working at various locations across a company’s power network. The occupation exists within an industry with a high level of safety critical activities, so there is a requirement for a disciplined and responsible approach to work. The work requires a good level of physical ability in order to access and egress work positions at height.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria. Apprenticeship candidates will normally have attained 3 to 5 GCSEs at grades A to C (including mathematics, English and a science), or equivalent qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are three specialisms within this occupation: working on overhead lines, on underground cables and in substation fitting. A successful apprentice will have met the core requirements and also one of the specialism requirements below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements:&amp;nbsp;Technical Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Electrical testing and the associated procedures needed to establish the condition of the plant, equipment, network and the actions needed as a result of the tests&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Electrical theories involved in the practical application of building and maintenance of electrical power networks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant electrical/mechanical principles and how they are applied in work processes and procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mathematical calculations used to support design, construction and ongoing operational maintenance activities related to power engineering&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Current Health, Safety and Environmental legislation and regulations applicable to work in the power sector&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Company rules, policies and procedures as defined by the employer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements: Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with focus and clear purpose in all weather conditions, covering 24/7 operations, sometimes working alone and safely adapt working methods to reflect changes in working environments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work on customer premises/property and on customer installations showing appropriate care and respect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use tools and equipment to construct and maintain electrical infrastructure across a range of voltages&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Take personal responsibility for maintaining safety standards and achieving job objectives&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a variety of appropriate communication methods to interact with others to give/receive information accurately, in a timely, positive and professional manner&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify that something is wrong/likely to go wrong and the appropriate solution(s) within current expertise&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Achieve individual and team tasks which align to overall work objectives, be self-motivated and disciplined in the approach to work tasks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare and sequence equipment and tasks in a certain order to a specific rule(s)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake standby duties to provide 24 hour cover to the network in fault situations requiring diagnostic testing procedures to analyse and calculate system parameters and rectification procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements: Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work well with people from different trades/disciplines, backgrounds and expertise to accomplish an activity safely and on time and meet customer requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deliver a polite, courteous professional service to all customers and members of the public&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be risk aware showing the desire to reduce risks through systematic monitoring &amp;amp;
