  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in outdoor sport, leisure, tourism, public health, youth work and education sectors. Apprentices are employed by charitable outdoor organisations, private and for-profit outdoor learning businesses, schools, expedition providers, social enterprises, etc. Outdoor Learning Specialists work within outdoor activity or education centres; outdoor adventure and activity businesses; expedition and sports tourism providers; early years, schools, colleges and universities; national parks, nature reserves and country parks; youth work and youth development organisations; health, wellbeing and social care contexts; and training and educational organisations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is the design, planning and delivery of programmes that provide progressive learning and change using outdoor activities and experiences. Typical impacts are educational achievement, personal and social development, health and wellbeing, nature connection, outdoor science, team cohesion, or practical skills development. In smaller organisations Outdoor Learning Specialists are likely to perform all duties of this standard within their role. In larger organisations their role may specialise in duties related to programme delivery, customer relationship management, staffing and team support, or safety and risk management for example. Outdoor Learning Specialists apply professional outdoor leadership judgement in order to facilitate safe and effective individual and group learning. Their technical and subject specific outdoor activity competence will have been developed through a mix of academic and vocational qualifications, and experience. They have a broad and specialised knowledge of the natural outdoor environment and determine likely hazards of undertaking activities and perform in-advance and in the moment (dynamic) risk – benefit assessments. They manage the allocated resources required for an outdoor learning programme, including delivery team, vehicles, trailers, technical equipment, catering, budget, etc. They are able to work autonomously to direct and support delivery staff and solve problems associated with a dynamic change in group, equipment, or environmental conditions using an appropriate problem solving, recovery, rescue or emergency response. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with programme participants; customers and stakeholders to identify needs and expectations, sequence, plan, monitor and report on the delivery of an outdoor learning programme; department heads of stores, hospitality, catering to prepare logistics; the allocated delivery team to direct their work on a programme; the operational or duty manager to report on safety and customer satisfaction; landowners, organisations, local communities, other users (human and fauna) where the outdoor learning programme is operating; and their line manager. They are able to perform in situations which are often physically and emotionally demanding, remote, unpredictable and complex. When the environment, weather conditions or individual circumstances change they will adapt their programme leadership approach to ensure the physical, social and emotional wellbeing of participants and the securing of interpersonal relationships of participants for prolonged periods of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for needs analysis &amp;amp; diagnosis, design, planning, execution and evaluation of outdoor learning development programmes for children, young people and adults. They will be informed by relevant policies, reports, evidence and research and comply with the Institute for Outdoor Learning (IOL) Code of Professional Conduct; first aid, safeguarding and professional liability responsibilities; and legislation including the Health and Safety at Work Act, Equality Act and Adventure Activity Licensing Regulations (or any replacement scheme which may come into force). Outdoor Learning Specialists facilitate the progressive development of activity competence, inter-personal and intra-personal life skills, outdoor and environmental knowledge and understanding. They will coach, mentor and provide feedback to allocated outdoor activity session delivery staff to develop their knowledge and skills in meeting the outcomes of the programme. They follow the principles of sustainable use and minimum impact to the natural environment and promote on-going activity participation and engagement with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;",
