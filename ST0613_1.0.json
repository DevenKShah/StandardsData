  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acoustics deals with all types of waves in a variety of different situations.&amp;nbsp; The waves may include sound and vibration in air and water, as well as very low (infra) and very high (ultra) sound waves. A knowledge of how these waves behave in different media has enabled technologies to develop in fields as diverse as architectural, musical and medical engineering. Acoustics is considered in many construction and major engineering projects, such as Crossrail, HS2, and The Sage Concert Hall Gateshead, amongst many others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Typically, companies that are involved in acoustics include specialist consulting firms for the built environment; planning consultants; construction companies; health and safety practitioners; entertainment and performing arts venues; product manufacturers; engineering, and national and local government.&amp;nbsp; Due to the specialist nature of the subject, an Acoustics Engineering Technician would commonly be part of a wider project team, focusing on the acoustic aspects of a project alongside fellow specialists such as Acoustics Consultants and Engineers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An Acoustics Engineering Technician will undertake tasks in support of practitioners in acoustics, including consultants, laboratories, local authorities, transport authorities and other engineering disciplines in a variety of professional areas.&amp;nbsp; Specific job roles that would be relevant to an Acoustics Engineering Technician would include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Architectural and Environmental Acoustics Technician&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acoustics Laboratory Technician&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acoustics Calibration Engineering Technician&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Supporting Environmental Health Practitioner for noise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acoustics Product Design Technician&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An Acoustics Engineering Technician understands the science of sound and vibration propagation and applies this to work areas relevant to their employer’s working practices. They often apply the same fundamental principles to solving acoustic problems in different contexts e.g. architectural and environmental acoustics would be applicable as part of a planning application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Typical duties would include noise/vibration surveying and testing; data acquisition, processing and analysis; calculation; specialist acoustics modelling; reporting; maintenance and calibration of equipment and client liaison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;An&amp;nbsp;Acoustics Engineering Technician has knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The principles and responsibilities, imposed law and other regulations in acoustics engineering environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scientific principles that underpin acoustics including the transmission of sound through different materials and behaviour and control of sound.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Identify risk of activities and apply safe working practices both in laboratory and site environments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan, measure, analyse and report acoustic data.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;Undertake acoustics calculations manually and using spreadsheets.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apply standards and guidance in the context of acoustics including those related to the built environment, construction, and laboratory/on-site testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;

For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship English and Maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualifications are an alternative to an English qualification for those for whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level : &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is our intention that successful apprentices will be eligible to register with the Engineering Council, at EngTech level.&amp;nbsp;This will be confirmed before the apprenticeship goes live.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
