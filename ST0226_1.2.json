Many businesses will be specialised in their activities, such as grounds maintenance (soft-landscape) or landscape construction (hard-landscape). Soft-landscaping includes the establishment and maintenance of plants and cultivated areas. Hard-landscaping includes establishment of hard surfaces and structures in addition to the establishment of plants in cultivated areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The distinct nature of these two specialisms means very few businesses can offer the full breadth of skills and therefore two options are available for this occupation; horticulture and landscape construction. The employment area will dictate the option pursued. The horticulture option focuses on plant propagation and plant growth. The landscape construction option focuses on the installation of features and structures; application of landscape materials as well as site management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Landscape or horticulture supervisor can manage a site with minimum supervision, supervise a team and maintain the health and safety and security of personnel and resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working and learning in the horticulture and landscape industries is rewarding, offers a diverse range of employment opportunities and includes a range of skills that are transferable into other industries following further studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Required skills, knowledge and behaviours to complete this apprenticeship&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Core knowledge - have an understanding of;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry understanding; the importance and benefits of green-space and different types of horticultural management appropriate to different sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business; project processes, planning work scheduling and requirements to meet specification, working to a budget.

Workers are often in isolated locations working in pairs or small teams and it can take some time for them to get help if an accident occurs. Responsible employers to meet the requirements of the law will make sure that a high proportion of their employees are first aid trained and to a sufficient level to deal with accidents that might occur. An Ofqual regulated qualification in first aid provides the assurance that the apprentice will have achieved the required standard to be safe working in the industry.
