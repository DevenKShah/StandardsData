  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This occupation is found in&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;the furniture and interiors, bench joinery, shopfitting, wood, sawmilling and bespoke machining industries. Wood machinists either machine wood components for use in these industries or convert round timber to boards and other products to required specification. For example, panelling, floorboards, kitchen counters, bars, banisters, spindles, skirting boards, window and door frames. Wood machinist&#39;s workplaces range from small workshops to large scale factories and sawmills. Employers vary in size from small to large.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;to cut and prepare timber and related material components. Wood machinists set up and operate variety of woodworking machines to surface, cut, and shape timber, and to fabricate parts for wood products, such as furniture components, doors, door and window frames, furniture, and sashes, according to specifications. They prepare and finish wood or wood-based components or sub-assemblies. They select, install, and adjust saw blades, cutterheads, boring bits, and sanding belts in respective machines, using hand tools and measuring equipment. They also inspect, pack and store finished components or sub-assemblies and contribute to continuous improvement activities. Completing documentation and cleaning up is also part of the role. The occupation can be physically demanding, involving lifting of heavy materials and standing for long periods of time. It involves working with dangerous machinery, tools and equipment. Wood machinists often work shift systems. The seasonality of the industry, plus peaks and troughs in orders, often demands overtime working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;other operatives, production or manufacturing managers, quality technicians, production leaders and product developers. Wood machinists typically report to a supervisor or shift team leader.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;completing their duties in line with company procedures and priorities. They are responsible for their own work and meeting production and quality targets. They must work within health, safety and environmental regulations and considerations. They must manage their own time and use the correct protective clothing, tools and equipment. Depending on the size of the organisation, they may be required to work on their own, or they may work as part of a wider team.&lt;/p&gt;",
