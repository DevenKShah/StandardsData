  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This occupation is found in all legal firms that deliver conveyancing, and, or probate legal services and advice. Licensed Conveyancer and Probate Practitioners work in a variety of legal teams and settings. They deal with a broad range of professional organisations or persons. These can include accountants, banks, local authorities, tax authorities, trusts, charities and property professionals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Licensed Conveyancers and Licensed Probate Practitioners work as principal fee earners. They have a significant level of autonomy and are responsible for compliance with Regulatory Arrangements and Lender requirements. Digital skills are increasingly important as is a due regard for the security and sensitivity of customer data. Licensed Conveyancers and Licensed Probate Practitioners need to understand their customers’ needs so that they can give the most appropriate service in the customer&#39;s best interests and in accordance with professional and ethical demands. They will handle customer monies and work closely with regulatory requirements to ensure that they provide an ethical service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Licensed Conveyancers are qualified, professional property lawyers who specialise in the legal aspects surrounding buying and selling property in England and Wales. Licensed Conveyancers are also Commissioners for Oaths. This means they have legal authority to administer and witness official documents such as affidavits to swear that a statement is the truth. A Licensed Conveyancer will ensure that all documentation, contracts and financial arrangements associated with buying or selling a property or piece of land are in order. They understand that each property transaction is unique and work closely with clients. Licensed Conveyancers work with clients who are the buyers and sellers of property and often also a lending institution. The role is varied as no two property transactions are the same. The Licensed Conveyancer helps clients often at a stressful time so they must be able to demonstrate empathy and understanding. Licensed Conveyancers can work anywhere that deals with the transfer of a title to property or land in a legal department headed by a qualified person. The scope of employment is not limited to a law firm. Licensed Conveyancers can work in housing associations, local authorities, banks and building societies to property development companies and even railways and airports.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Licensed Probate Practitioners are qualified, professional probate lawyers. They specialise in the legal aspects surrounding inheritance and the administration of Wills and estates in England and Wales. Licensed Probate Practitioners are experts in the legal documentation and processes for dealing with the affairs of a deceased person (“estate”). They advise and draft Wills and Lasting Powers of Attorney. They liaise with the deceased’s representatives to administer the estate in accordance with their Will. When the deceased has not left a Will, they work under the Intestacy provisions. Licensed Probate Practitioners are also Commissioners for Oaths. This means they have legal authority to administer and witness official documents, such as, affidavits to swear that a statement is the truth. Licensed Probate Practitioners work in a variety of legal settings recognised in the private client industry, including Licensed Conveyancing or Solicitors’ practices. The role is varied as no two estates are the same. The Licensed Probate Practitioner helps clients often at an emotional time and so must be able to demonstrate empathy and understanding. They must be vigilant to the needs and risks posed to vulnerable clients such as the elderly to ensure that their interests are protected.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for work managing and guiding junior staff such as conveyancing technicians and probate technicians.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Licensed Conveyancing and Licensed Probate Practitioner Apprenticeship is one of several equivalent ways to qualify as a Licensed Conveyancer or Probate Practitioner and become an Authorised Person.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
