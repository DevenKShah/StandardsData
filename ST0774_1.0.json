They will have a case load of patients, which may be in the optical practice, external facilities or the patient’s home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dispensing opticians use a range of specialist equipment to perform duties. They provide advice and guidance to the patient about products, managing their expectations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#39;Arial&#39;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; color: #334047; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;They oversee their own work and that of supervised optical assistants. Line management and supervisory duties will depend on the size of the practice. They may work in a technical advisory role within a range of organisations such as the production of optical products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dispensing opticians are responsible for their own development. With further study they may progress to practicing in a speciality such as a contact lens optician, or becoming a business owner or manager of a service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
