  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide range of specialist vessels, both commercial and military such as tugs, multi-purpose workboats, aquaculture and fast pilot boats. It also covers crew transfer vessels that take personnel out to vessels or installations offshore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Small Commercial Vessels operate in varying marine environments such as construction of offshore wind farms, providing a range of services within a port or inland waterways, including surveys and towage. In addition, they may act as support vessels in major salvage operations and wreck removal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many employers are based around the coastal ports of the UK or by rivers and canals. They range from large organisations like the Royal Navy, through to small private operators offering specialist services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to complete mission specific tasks that cannot be completed by land. They typically do this by navigating a specialist vessel to the site and then using the machinery and equipment on that vessel. They must be able to carry out all core tasks on board a vessel with minimal supervision, including but not limited to; communication, navigation and vessel handling, berthing, access &amp;amp; egress, towing operations, laying moorings, personnel transfers and cargo handling&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Small Commercial Vessel Crewmembers usually work in teams of 2 or 3 people onboard, including the Master who is in overall charge. While some tasks can be completed within a day, some missions can instead involve vessels being at sea for weeks. This means crewmembers must work flexibly and take their turn to be in charge, for instance when the vessel Master is asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Small Commercial Vessel Crewmember must make key decisions on safety, security and navigation, sometimes in rapidly changing situations. Their work directly impacts the safety of all those onboard and also impacts protection of the marine environment. A Small Commercial Vessel Crewmember can expect their working patterns to vary considerably, depending on the mission. Some might normally work day shifts. However, this occupation can include working at any time of day or night and in all weathers. Lengthy operations at sea are potentially followed by a similar length of leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the Master of the vessel, who they report to, and other crew members.&amp;nbsp; They may also interact with other professionals, such as passengers they are transferring, or seafarers on board other vessels. A Small Commercial Vessel Crewmember interacts with colleagues ashore, alongside, and on fixed structures at sea (e.g. oil platforms). This could include engineers, port and navigational authorities, Coastguard Officers and other Search and Rescue professionals. As well as interacting in person, it’s common for a lot of communication to involve UHF or VHF radio, mobile phones, and onboard IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for following the instruction of the Master of the vessel, and discharging their duties on the vessel compliantly by following regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are also responsible for their vessel whenever they are navigating, mooring/anchoring, steering or keeping watch. They must use bridge equipment to check the vessel position. They must manoeuvre a vessel, bring it alongside, and handle mooring ropes to secure the vessel. They must use equipment like winches correctly (if provided). They must guide on safe transfer of personnel from and to their vessel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are also responsible for fulfilling mission specific tasks, by correctly using specialist equipment and machinery onboard the vessel (e.g., when handling cargo, they must assist in slinging of loads, crane operations and securing cargo on board).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Small Commercial Vessel Crewmember must also take appropriate action and respond during emergencies to ensure the safety of the vessel and those working on board. When needed, they must provide emergency first aid. Working together in a very small team to meet mission objectives is a key feature of this occupation.&lt;/p&gt;",
