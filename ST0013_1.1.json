Software is an intrinsic component of the systems used to deliver in-service support. Following the in-service date, Software Engineering delivers support, optimises and upgrades the Support System infra-structure. These are considered to be Sustainment activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All engineers must comply with statutory regulations and organisational safety requirements. They must be able to use and interpret engineering data and documentation such as engineering requirements, specifications, designs, code, test specifications, test scripts, code analysis (static and dynamic) tool output.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Software engineers will be expected to work both as individuals and as part of wider Engineering teams.&amp;nbsp; They will be expected to demonstrate coding ability and specify, analyse, test and modify Software Engineering artefacts across Design and Development and In-Service Operations. They will be expected to validate, test and modify the software to comply with its design and associate requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The requirements are designed to offer stretch and progression. Higher Apprentices will be able to work with appropriate supervision, whilst taking progressively more responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake.

Apprentices without Level 2 Maths and English must achieve this prior to taking the end-point assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&amp;nbsp; (*Equal to 240 UCAS points prior to 2017,**Equal to Grades C and above).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical Duration of Apprenticeship &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 48 months - timescales may vary depending on occupational role and/or prior relevant qualifications/experience and Assessment of Prior Learning and Knowledge (APL/K) opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mandatory Qualifications &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 4 Diploma in Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing (Development Competence)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 6 Bachelor Honours Degree (BEng or BSc) Stipulated by the employer and accredited by an Engineering Council licenced Professional Engineering Institution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of the qualification requirements in the foundation and development phases are mandatory outcomes for the completion and final certification of the Apprenticeship Standard. Each qualification has a core and options approach and employers will select the most applicable pathway and unit options to meet their organisational requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be an end-point assessment during the final phase of the Apprenticeship where the apprentice will need to demonstrate to the employer how they have achieved full occupational competence against, skills, knowledge and behaviours, set out in the Standard&amp;nbsp; On successful completion of the end-point assessment and employer endorsement phase (final sign off) apprentices will be then be put forward to be awarded their Apprenticeship completion certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard aligns with the current edition of the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC) at Incorporated Engineering (IEng) level. The experience gained and responsibility held by the apprentice on completion of the apprenticeship will either wholly or partially satisfy the requirements for IEng and reaches the agreed level of professional competence as defined in the Assessment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level and Review &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard is at Level 6 and will be reviewed as a minimum every three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is predominately found in the aerospace sector but may also be used more widely. The occupation can be found in large, medium and small employers across the world. Aerospace software engineers may work on specific aerospace products.&amp;nbsp; They may also work on bespoke tooling and associated integrated aerospace environments and infrastructure. Employment examples include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;aerospace manufacturers,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;aerospace support services,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;aerospace infrastructure suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to design, develop and test, real-time safety-critical software. They develop embedded aircraft software and stand-alone applications used in aircraft support. They develop and test tools that support the creation of aerospace related software. They support customers and suppliers by maintaining and improving software utilities and tools. They develop processes for the development and test of products. They review performance, design, test and use project management and continuous improvement techniques. They proactively find solutions to problems and identify areas for business improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aerospace software engineers are typically office-based. They may be required to work in simulation rig testing facilities, or in operational environments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation may interact with customers. They may also interact with system operators, other specialist engineers, technicians, partners and suppliers.&amp;nbsp; They also interact with colleagues across other areas in their organisation. For example, manufacturing, project management, quality assurance, finance, human resources and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They typically report to Senior Engineers, Senior Specialists or Chief Engineers depending on the organisation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for working ethically and professionally. They work to Civil and Military Aviation regulatory requirements. They must meet statutory and company regulations. For example, health and safety, environment and sustainability, cost, quality, accuracy and efficiency. Aerospace Software Engineers work individually and as part of a team.&amp;nbsp; They are responsible for the safety and security of the product they create. Depending on the size and structure of the organisation they may manage software technicians or teams of engineers.&lt;/p&gt;",
