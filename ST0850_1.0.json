  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the public and private sector in organisations such as the Police, large fleet operators and civil litigation law firms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to investigate and reconstruct road traffic and other vehicle-related incidents using scientific and engineering principles to determine how an incident occurred. Practitioners provide expert opinion to relevant parties including courts and other arenas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with Departments, fleet operators or individuals dealing with internal or external complaints or insurance claims, Criminal, Civil and Coroners Courts, the Employment Disciplinary &amp;amp; Tribunal process and members of the legal profession.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for identifying, preserving and recording physical evidence from the scene of an incident. This includes photographing / videoing the incident scene and as appropriate, surveying the scene, preparing scale plans and other visual representations, conducting tests or forensic examinations towards building a reconstruction. Sometimes these road collision incidents can be traumatic.They will review witness evidence, test it against the physical evidence and use expert knowledge to provide analysis and provide advice and guidance to support an investigation. They produce key documents such as briefing notes, technical and expert witness reports which could be used in court as evidence for a criminal conviction and liaise with relevant parties to present the findings of the investigation and reconstruction. They provide ‘expert’ testimony at court or any hearing, complying with the legislative requirements of the Criminal Procedure Rules and the Civil Procedure Rules as appropriate. Although working as part of a multi-disciplinary team, they have sole responsibility for the investigation including the production and sign off of reports..&lt;/p&gt;",
