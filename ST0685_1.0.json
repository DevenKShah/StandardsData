The broad purpose of the occupation is to create, implement and adapt tailored holistic and wellbeing experiences, in a variety of environments, meeting and managing treatment and experience outcomes in private, secure and safe environments. Wellbeing and Holistic therapists complete treatments and wellbeing experiences via holistic therapy principles, theories and applications to calm or stimulate the sensory perceptions of the body and mind in the pursuit of optimal functioning and balance of the physical, emotional and mental aspects of daily life. This results in a dynamic state of equilibrium and wellbeing for the client. Wellbeing therapists deliver specific treatments such as; aromatherapy, acupressure (manual digit pressure massage applied by the hands to specific points on the face or body) and holistic massage (therapeutic hands-on massage therapy that affects the clients physical, emotional and mental wellbeing), Indian head massage, lymphatic drainage and wellness experiences. They provide post treatment aftercare and make future recommendations. They contribute to the commercial viability and effectiveness of the business to enhance the client experience. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other health and non-health care practitioners including therapists such as beauty, spa, wellbeing and holistic as part of multi-disciplinary teams and sometimes and clinical specialists.
