Conveyancers manage client portfolios in residential, commercial and agricultural contexts and provide conveyancing legal services on behalf of private individuals, commercial and charitable organisations, housing associations, public authorities, building companies, mortgage lenders, including banks and building societies.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Conveyancing Apprenticeship is one of a number of equivalent ways to qualify as a Licensed Conveyancer and become an Authorised Person; Regulators approve Authorised Persons to carry out reserved legal activities e.g. a Licensed Conveyancer; a Solicitor; a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting the competency standards of the apprenticeship will enable the successful apprentice to become eligible to apply for a professional Licence to provide the reserved activity of conveyancing to members of the public and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Licensed Conveyancers work as principal fee earners, have a significant level of autonomy and are responsible for compliance with Regulatory Arrangements and Lender requirements. You will understand that each property transaction is unique and will work closely with clients who are the buyers and sellers of property and often also a lending institution. As a Licensed Conveyancer your primary responsibility will be to provide an ethical and efficient legal service to the client/consumer and you will do this by:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;upholding &#160;the Firms policies and procedures and The Regulator’s Codes of Conduct;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;delivering professionally and ethically satisfactory outcomes on behalf of the client(s) and the business;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;managing a complex case load of property and land transactions;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;providing professional supervision to others; including but not limited to Conveyancing Technicians.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Achieving the apprenticeship will enable you to independently conduct, manage and deliver all legal processes and requirements in relation to the broadest range of property and land transactions; qualifying you to carry out work in residential, commercial and agricultural conveyancing employment.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To be able to conduct complex land and property matters candidates will need to demonstrate they have an in depth knowledge and a broad range of experience in all areas of property and land transactions. On successful completion of the apprenticeship you will:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;be a professional licensed accountable person in a legal environment and therefore able to provide legal services, including advice and guidance to clients/consumers;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;be able to assess legal, regulatory and commercial risk related to property and land transactions;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;be able to prioritise and plan the most appropriate actions for the business in which you work and in your clients best interests&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;be able to effectively&#160; manage dealings with other lawyers and professional third parties;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;be able to reliably manage clients/consumers and their expectations;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;know how to manage legal files, case management and accounting systems;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;know how to draft and review all the legal documents related to property and land transactions;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understand how your work contributes to broader business targets.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Day-One-Outcomes set the benchmark for performance upon qualification to provide a reserved legal activity. As a successful Apprentice you will be able to demonstrate the full range of knowledge, skills, values and behaviours of a qualified Licensed Conveyancer, and evidence that you are able to conduct and deliver a full range of Conveyancing services. You will do this by meeting the requirements of the Day-One-Outcomes contained in this standard, which are:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.
