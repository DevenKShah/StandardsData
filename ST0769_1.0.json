  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Cultural Heritage, Historic Environment and Education sectors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to plan, undertake and lead Archaeological Research and Investigation, which may comprise surveys, excavation, post-excavation analysis and scientific analysis of archaeological materials and data. Archaeological Specialists have specialised knowledge of one or more aspects of archaeological investigation and analysis. They are responsible for the processing, reporting and preparation for long-term deposition of archaeological data and materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with organisations of all sizes in the public, private and third sectors. Typically, they interact with colleagues, external stakeholders and members of the public. Archaeological Specialists work on site (outside, all weathers), in an office or in a laboratory, including operating technical equipment and carrying out physical tasks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading and undertaking Archaeological Research and Investigation, with a high level of responsibility for the delivery and quality of their own work and that of others. They are responsible for providing a specialist resource to colleagues. The size of the employer will impact the team the Archaeological Specialist is responsible for, or interacts with, but typically they will train and supervise less skilled personnel, and be responsible for the delivery of programmes and projects of all sizes and complexities, as well as communicating the results of the work internally and externally.&lt;/p&gt;",
