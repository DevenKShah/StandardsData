  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in healthcare under the profession of dentistry. Dental nurses work in a clinical environment that could be located in a NHS general dental practice, hospital, private dental practice, specialist dental practice, community dental service or military dental clinic. The clinical environment is called a dental surgery and consists of a dental chair, x-ray unit and various equipment and instruments required for dentistry. An apprentice will predominately work with a dentist, dental hygienist, dental therapist, clinical dental technician or orthodontic therapist within a surgery environment with patients attending throughout the day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide chair side support to all dental professionals and ensure high standards of cleanliness and infection control. Dental nurses prepare instruments, materials and medicaments for dental procedures, mix materials, sterilise instruments, keep records, note dictation, carry out stock control and ensure patient comfort and safety throughout their visit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients of all ages, other members of the dental team, other health professionals and representatives of organisations providing support services to the setting. Depending on the dental setting the dental nurse could also interact with schools, the prison service, community dental service, individuals in their own homes and those in care home settings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing care for people of all ages, different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs within a variety of clinical environments. Dental nurses must ensure that they only carry out a task, treatment or make decisions about a patientâ€™s care if they are appropriately trained, competent, indemnified and have the necessary skills. Dental nurses are registered professionals and work within the standards and scope of practice as defined by the General Dental Council Scope of Practice document.&lt;/p&gt;",
