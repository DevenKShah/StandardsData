  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Dentistry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to become a registered professional who fits, adjusts and removes braces to patient’s teeth, working to the prescription of an orthodontist or dentist competent in orthodontics. They provide holistic advice on maintaining oral and general health for patients who are undergoing orthodontic treatment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with patients of all ages who present with dental malocclusions (problems with the development, alignment and the way teeth fit together), the wider orthodontic and dental team, parents, guardians and carers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for undertaking reversible orthodontic procedures, which include bonding brackets on the teeth, fitting and changing wires and accessories that connect to the brackets, fitting removable appliances and retainers, following an appropriate prescription. They will respond appropriately to a treatment plan from the orthodontist, gaining valid consent from the patient and guardian, and giving appropriate advice. They will be able to make appliances safe in the absence of the dentist and respond appropriately to emergencies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scope of practice for orthodontic therapists is set out by the General Dental Council who regulate this occupation. Further details of the regulatory requirements can be found in the following General Dental Councils documents: ‘Preparing for Practice,’ ‘Standards for Education’ and ‘Standards for the Dental Team’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Orthodontic Therapists work as part of wider dental team that includes dentists or orthodontists, dental nurses, dental hygienists, dental therapists, dental technicians, clinical dental technicians, practice managers, administrators and laboratory staff. Depending on the practice they work in, Orthodontic Therapists may supervise colleagues, trainees or students. The dentist or orthodontist prescribes the treatments that an Orthodontic Therapist will carry out, including taking impressions, placing fixed brackets and arch wires on teeth, fitting tooth separators, undertaking radiographs and occlusal bite registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the apprenticeship apprentices must be supervised by a suitably trained orthodontist on the specialist list maintained by the General Dental Council.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They must be a Registered General Dental Council dental nurse, dental hygienist, dental therapist or dental technician prior to commencing this apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;",
