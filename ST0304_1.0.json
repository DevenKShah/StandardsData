  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Modern policing is undergoing significant transformation and highly competent PCs are vital to the delivery of an enhanced service to the public.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Being a PC is a physically and intellectually demanding occupation, requiring high levels of emotional intelligence, strong behavioural interpretation skills and an ability to analyse and resolve rapidly evolving events. PCs have a unique employment status, as every PC is a warranted officer, making autonomous lawful decisions including taking away an individual’s liberty if required. PCs exercise wide-ranging powers to maintain the peace and uphold the law across complex and diverse communities. They must justify and personally account for their actions through differing legal frameworks including courts, while also under the close scrutiny of the public. Competent PCs work safely and lawfully, intelligently applying a wide range and depth of skills, knowledge and behaviours to many different and increasingly complex policing contexts, for example the management of a sensitive investigation into the sharing of sexual imagery involving vulnerable victims and witnesses, or the protection of vulnerable people, including those with mental health problems. A high level of knowledge is required to confidently respond to these complex scenarios. Increasingly PCs are individually responsible for determining, applying and evaluating practice based on the best available evidence, known as evidence-based policing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Tasks can include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;provision of an initial autonomous response to incidents, which can be complex, confrontational and life-threatening, to bring about the best possible outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;conducting risk and threat analyses across wide-ranging, multi-faceted situations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;investigating incidents and crimes, managing crime scenes and evidence, and handling suspects&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;providing leadership to the public, and supporting victims, witnesses and vulnerable people&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;developing localised strategic partnerships to problem-solve, engage with, reassure and support organisations, groups and individuals across all communities.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These vary from force to force. Typically a PC will be 18 or older, and is highly likely to have achieved a Level 3 qualification (or equivalent) and Level 2 in English and Mathematics (or equivalents) prior to entry.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=&quot;width: 2370px;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 790px;&quot;
