  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Modern policing is undergoing significant transformation and highly competent PCs are vital to the delivery of an enhanced service to the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Being a PC is a physically and intellectually demanding occupation, requiring high levels of emotional intelligence, strong behavioural interpretation skills and an ability to analyse and resolve rapidly evolving events. PCs have a unique employment status, as every PC is a warranted officer, making autonomous lawful decisions including taking away an individual’s liberty if required. PCs exercise wide-ranging powers to maintain the peace and uphold the law across complex and diverse communities. They must justify and personally account for their actions through differing legal frameworks including courts, while also under the close scrutiny of the public. Competent PCs work safely and lawfully, intelligently applying a wide range and depth of skills, knowledge and behaviours to many different and increasingly complex policing contexts, for example the management of a sensitive investigation into the sharing of sexual imagery involving vulnerable victims and witnesses, or the protection of vulnerable people, including those with mental health problems. A high level of knowledge is required to confidently respond to these complex scenarios. Increasingly PCs are individually responsible for determining, applying and evaluating practice based on the best available evidence, known as evidence-based policing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tasks can include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;provision of an initial autonomous response to incidents, which can be complex, confrontational and life-threatening, to bring about the best possible outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;conducting risk and threat analyses across wide-ranging, multi-faceted situations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;investigating incidents and crimes, managing crime scenes and evidence, and handling suspects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;providing leadership to the public, and supporting victims, witnesses and vulnerable people&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;developing localised strategic partnerships to problem-solve, engage with, reassure and support organisations, groups and individuals across all communities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These vary from force to force. Typically a PC will be 18 or older, and is highly likely to have achieved a Level 3 qualification (or equivalent) and Level 2 in English and Mathematics (or equivalents) prior to entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge - the Police Constable will know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ethics and values of professional policing, including: duty of care, service delivery, employment practice, efficiency, effectiveness and value for money, Code of Ethics, professional standards, and equality, diversity and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key cross-cutting and inter-dependent areas of policing, including: roles and responsibilities, criminal justice, counter terrorism, vulnerability (including public protection and mental health) and risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicable aspects of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/&quot;&gt;Authorised Professional Practice &lt;/a&gt;(the official source of policing professional practice), legal and organisational requirements relating to the operational policing context (response, community, intelligence, investigation and roads/transport), including how to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 230px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;effectively respond to incidents, preserving scenes and evidence when necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;manage and resolve conflict safely and lawfully&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;arrest, detain and report individuals safely and lawfully&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;conduct diligent and efficient, priority and high volume investigations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;effectively interview victims, witnesses and suspects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 230px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;systematically gather, submit and share information and intelligence to further policing-related outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;meticulously and ethically search individuals, vehicles, premises and outside and virtual spaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;optimise the use of available technology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;risk manage health and safety for self and for others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How to interpret and apply the letter and essence of all relevant law, as it relates to any encountered policing situation, incident or context.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social behaviour and society, including their origins, development, organisation, networks and institutions and how this relates to policing across diverse and increasingly complex communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The causes, mitigations and prevention of crime and how this knowledge and understanding can influence and be applied to accountable decision-making in all operational policing environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;In-depth knowledge, understanding and expertise relevant to organisational/local needs, including the following operational policing contexts: response, community, intelligence, investigation and roads/transport.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;width: 460px;&quot;&gt;Different approaches to systematic evidence-based preventative policing, including how to critically analyse, interpret, implement, share and evaluate findings to problem solve and further positive outcomes.
