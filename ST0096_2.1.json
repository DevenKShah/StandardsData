Project size will vary in size ranging from domestic repairs to larger contracts for home builders, commercial and retail developments. Employers and contractors of plasterers vary in size from small, local family building companies to major home builders and commercial contractors. Plasterers may choose to specialise in specific projects and progress to become masters in their field. The demand for plasterers is consistently high to support growth both in new build homes and commercial projects but also home renovation projects and heritage work on listed buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; color: #334047; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot;&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #334047; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;to apply layers of plaster onto walls and ceilings. Plastering serves a protective function in that it makes buildings more robust, an aesthetic function as well as providing thermal values and fire protection. Plasterers need to have knowledge of dry lining to support their knowledge and skills to plaster. Solid plastering involves applying a range of plastering systems on to different background surfaces such as solid plain walls, walls with openings and returns, ceiling joists and partitions and beams using traditional and modern materials. Solid plasterers would work on site. Fibrous plastering involves creating plaster components with either a modern or contemporary design, ornamental enrichment to classical design such as column casings, ceiling roses, cornices, panel mouldings and many more. A fibrous plasterer would produce work in a workshop in addition to installing products on site. Fibrous work can be found in traditional and modern buildings and sometimes in the film industry.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; color: #334047; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot;&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #334047; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;commercial, retail and domestic customers, other trades and the site management team, which could include a craft plasterer who will direct the work of the plastering team. They will also liaise with other construction trades such as bricklayers, carpenters and decorators. Plasterers can work on their own or as part of a small team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; background: white; vertical-align: baseline;&quot; class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;,sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; color: #334047; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;&quot;&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #334047; font-family: &#39;Open Sans&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;for producing high quality work which meets standards, specifications and design plans. They are expected to comply with all safety aspects involved with working on a construction site, ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of themselves and others at all times. With sustainable construction at the forefront of all projects, it is expected they would give consideration to the environment and suitability of material, waste awareness and recycling. An apprentice who completed this level can progress onto specialising in either fibrous plastering, solid plastering or external rendering&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",
