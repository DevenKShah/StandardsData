  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Demolition Operatives carry out the process of demolishing or part-demolishing structures ranging from standard brick and concrete buildings to bridges, industrial plants and power stations. It is a safety-critical role, utilising hand and power tools to carry out demolition work to strict operating procedures to ensure the demolition process is continuously and safely under control.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Demolition Operative role is the entry-level route into the demolition industry. By its very nature, it is a dangerous role and that is why all Operatives are supervised at all times by Supervisors and/or Chargehands. Typical hazards are numerous and include falling debris, burning steel, cables and hot works so an operative must constantly risk-assess surroundings to ensure safety to self and the wider team. They may be required to work at height, offshore, in confined spaces or in conjunction with other construction operations.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Demolition Operatives provide a support role in demolition projects and would typically be involved in a range of tasks, as part of a team and under supervision, including: using hand and power tools to remove internal parts of buildings such as doors, radiators and ceilings; using a range of heating and cutting equipment to burn through different types of metals; carrying out lifting operations working with several types of lifting equipment ranging from hoists to cranes; being aware of the requirement to protect the environment and recycle materials.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The UK demolition sector is made up of over 650 companies ranging from small regional operations to major contractors operating internationally. Major demolition projects have included the demolition of the Tottenham Hotspur football stadium, Hinkley A Nuclear Power Station, Old Oak Common for HS2 and the US Embassy. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Demolition Operatives are required to know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Demolition Procedures and Methods&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The planning process for demolition operations, utilising standards, the role of Building Information Modelling and Computer Aided Design&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;What is covered in a refurbishment and demolition survey, why it is intrusive and the importance of destructive inspection&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The decommissioning of services to structures and the requirement to render safe prior to any work being carried out&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The approach and methods of demolition manually by hand or mechanical, including soft strip, wall, floor, roofing &amp;amp; fa&#231;ade retention&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Hand and Power tools for demolition Operations&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The different types of hand and power tools used for carrying out demolition operations, when to use and the limitations of use&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The hazards associated with hand and power tools, safe working procedures to be applied for storage, use and replacement&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The remote-controlled demolition equipment available to the demolition operative, advantages and limitations of use&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Different types of structures and materials&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The structural elements of buildings including – beams, lintels, columns, trusses, roofing components and modern building materials&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The characteristics and different types of building and structure, traditional brick, reinforced concrete, industrial units and plants, power stations, bridges and complex structures and pre/post tensioned steel&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fuel cutting operations&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The hazards associated with cutting equipment and the safe working procedures to be applied for storage, use and replacement&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;What cutting fuels and equipment are available to the demolition operative and the circumstances in which they would be used&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The methods of cutting and effects on materials, metals and stability when pre-weakening structures&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Health, Safety and Environmental Protection&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Health, safety &amp;amp; environmental legislation relevant to demolition operations, official guidance and codes of practice&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The dangers, hazards and importance of safe working in confined spaces, at height, below ground and in close proximity to other operations and working on contaminated ground&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How and why safe systems of work are established along with the permits and authorisation to carry out the work&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Occupational health as a result of exposure to manual handling, noise, dust and vibration including the effects on hearing, lung related diseases and other injuries to the body both mental and physical&#160;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The control of substances hazardous to health, how to protect the environment and the importance of segregating and recycling&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Lifting &amp;amp; Demolition Plant Operations&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The duties and responsibilities of a slinger signaller and the importance of safety around lifting operations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to read the ‘The lift plan’ and identify correct lifting accessories for the load type and how the load should be slung&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How different types of demolition plant equipment are utilised along with the hazards and importance of exclusion zones and segregation&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Your Organisation and the wider Demolition Industry&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The role of the Demolition Operative and limitations on works to be carried out&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The structure of a demolition team and the appointments within – Topman, Supervisor, Manager&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Associations and institutes representing the industry&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills.
