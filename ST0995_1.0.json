  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This occupation is found in&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;a large range of employers across the NHS, General Practitioner practices, universities (both in teaching and research roles), research institutes, Public Health, local authorities, a range of industries such as pharma and biotechnology, and the voluntary and independent sector. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is that&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;doctors apply the principles and procedures of medicine to assess, prevent, diagnose, care for and treat patients with illness, disease and injury and to maintain physical and mental health. They supervise the delivery of care and treatment plans by others in the health care team and conduct medical education and research. They also deal with population health and disease prevention and work with related fields in industry. Doctors must have the ability to assimilate new knowledge, evaluate evidence critically and have strong intellectual skills and understanding of scientific principles. They must be able to deal with and manage uncertain and complex situations. All doctors must be committed to reflective practice, monitoring their contribution and always working to improve their own and their team&#39;s performance. The doctor must possess the ability to work effectively as a member of a healthcare team. They must recognise and respect the skills and attributes of other professionals and of patients. Patients with long term and disabling conditions are particularly likely to be experts in their own condition. All doctors have a role in the maintenance and promotion of population health, through evidence-based practice. Some will take on roles in health education or research whilst others will work in service improvement and re-design or in public health. Others will work in the commercial or charity sectors in which expert medical knowledge needs to be deployed. Recognising the primacy of the individual doctor: patient relationship, the doctor must view the needs of the patient in the context of the wider health needs of the population. Wherever a doctor is employed the patient must come first. As a critical decision maker, the doctor must be capable of both management and leadership and of taking ultimate responsibility for clinical decisions, while simultaneously being an effective team member. Doctors have a duty to use resources effectively and engage in constructive debate about their use. They should ensure that their own and others&#39; skills and knowledge are used to the best possible effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On successful completion of the apprenticeship, which will include the Medical Licensing Assessment, apprentices will be eligible to apply to the General Medical Council for provisional registration. This allows the individual to apply for a place on an approved UK Foundation Training Programme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Patients, service users and carers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Registered healthcare professionals, for example: other doctors, medical associate professionals, registered nurses, nursing associates, allied health professionals and healthcare support workers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social care staff including registered managers, care workers and social workers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Administration, management and other non-clinical staff like porters, cleaners, and receptionists&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Students training for a range of roles in healthcare&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Researchers and academics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensuring they understand and apply the professional duties and expectations required by the General Medical Council&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applying their knowledge and skills to assess, diagnose and treat the patients&#39; healthcare needs, or to know what steps need to be taken to achieve such an outcome taking into account patients personal and social circumstances&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supporting patients in understanding their condition and what they might expect, including times when patients present with symptoms that could have several causes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identifying, advising on and delivering appropriate treatment options or preventive measures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Explaining and discussing the risks, benefits and uncertainties of various tests and treatments and where possible supporting patients to make decisions about their own care.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing education and support to students training for a range of roles in healthcare&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitating the advancement of evidence-based practice&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assessing and managing risk; this requires high-level decision-making skills and the ability to work outside defined protocols when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prescribing medication or alternative treatments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keeping medical records&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Making difficult decisions in situations of clinical complexity and uncertainty, drawing on their knowledge and clinical judgement and considering what is in the best interest of patients and of the population served&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintaining their own physical and mental wellbeing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working with the multi-disciplinary team across multiple care setting&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supervising junior staff&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing themselves as lifelong learners, acquiring disparate skills as required by the direction in which their career is progressing, which may include some of the following functions: clinical care, education, research, leadership and management, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doctors have a key role in enhancing clinical services through their positions of responsibility. Some will move on from clinical leadership and management to leadership roles within organisations at various levels nationally and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is constantly changing alongside the needs and expectations of patients and where patients are increasingly better informed and act as partners in their own healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Doctors will work shifts including unsocial hours and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of the apprenticeship and subject to satisfactory confirmation of Fitness to Practise by the GMC progression will be into the Foundation Programme to undertake a further higher-level programme of workplace-based, supervised training before they are eligible for full registration with the General Medical Council and able to progress to further speciality training posts.&lt;/p&gt;",
