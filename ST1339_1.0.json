  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Bulk storage terminal technicians work in bulk storage terminals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bulk storage terminals provide storage and logistics infrastructure services. They provide an essential link in the supply chain for a large variety of products including transport and heating fuels, gasses, chemicals, and food-grade products such as animal feeds and fats, oils, and molasses. Bulk storage terminals provide and support an essential interface between sea, road, rail, waterway, and pipeline logistics and are strategically located in ports and airports, logistic platforms, along rivers, canals, and pipelines.&amp;nbsp;Bulk storage ensures that products are supplied when they are needed and in the quantities required.&amp;nbsp;Many terminals are designated as critical national infrastructure by the UK Government - necessary for a country to function and upon which daily life depends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As national and international efforts to tackle climate change by reducing carbon emissions become ever more important, the bulk storage sector will continue to grow in the coming years. From helping to unlock the potential of hydrogen, to the scale up of sustainable biofuels, the industry will have a key role to play in energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A terminal may provide third party storage or store their own products. They could store a single product or multiple products. They may provide supplementary services such as blending, packaging, canning, drum filling, water treatment and analysis, warehousing, and bonded alcohol storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Safety is a top concern for bulk storage companies. The Health and Safety Executive, Environmental Agencies, and other industry regulators inspect employers. The Control of Major Accident Hazards (COMAH) Regulations applies to some terminals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bulk storage terminal technicians operate the import and export of bulk products and conduct monitoring, treatment, and quality assurance during its storage. The transfer of products can be to or from ship, via pipelines, to or from road or rail tankers, or from tank to tank. Maintaining workplace health, safety, and environmental compliance is a vital part of the role. They will also conduct preventative maintenance, prepare equipment for shut-down, and reinstate it. They are often required to work outdoors. They need to wear specialist personal protective equipment (PPE) and may work at height or in confined spaces. They may be required to work shifts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a daily basis, they work with other members of the operations team, suppliers, and customers. They also have contact with other departments within the company for example, maintenance engineers and laboratory staff. They may work alone and as part of a team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are responsible for ensuring that the service meets regulatory and customer requirements. They must follow industry health, safety, environmental, and sustainability working practices. Quality, security, contract conditions and product requirements must also be met. They work with minimal supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake.&lt;/p&gt;",
