  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s gas network consists of approximately 286,000 kilometres (175,00 miles) of pipeline that supplies natural gas from on shore terminals through to 21.5 million gas users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is a hazardous substance. The safe operation, control and maintenance of the gas network is essential to avert major loss or interruption to supplies, this includes responding to and managing gas emergency situations to ensure potential safety issues are controlled and remediated without delay. This is the basis of the Gas Network Craftsperson’s occupation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gas Network Craftsperson’s are employed by organisations authorised to transport gas throughout the United Kingdom. These organisations vary from very large companies who own and operate networks that supply towns and cities across a wide geographical area, through to small companies who own independent networks that supply small housing developments with as few as 3 or 4 properties. They could be directly employed by the organisation that owns and/or manages the gas network or by an organisation that contracts their services to the networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work as part of a larger team, which may include planners, designers, supervisors and managers. They are often deployed to site in pairs or alone, dependent on the activity being undertaken. Good communication skills are essential as the may have to interact with the general public, agencies and emergency services on safety related matters and also provide technical advice to other stakeholders. The projects worked on could have values in excess of &#163;250,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation incorporates 4 specialist roles; the main duties and tasks for each role are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Maintenance Craftsperson (Electrical &amp;amp; Instrumentation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responsible for maintaining the controls and systems that measure, monitor, analyse and control the performance of the gas network. This forms part of a control system architecture that uses computers, networked data communications and graphical user interfaces for high-level process supervisory management associated with the gas transportation network. This may include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Installing instrumentation and communications technology associated with the control of gas within the gas transportation network&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Testing and maintaining instrumentation and communications systems associated with the control of gas within the gas transportation network&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Responding to faults and taking action to restore operating systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and reporting on the performance of electrical and instrumentation control systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Maintenance Craftsperson (Pressure Management)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responsible for maintaining the controls and systems that measure, monitor and analyse pressures and flows within the gas network to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the gas transportation network. This may include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Installing and maintaining equipment that controls flows and pressures within the gas transportation network in accordance with company procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Responding to faults and taking action to restore systems to full operation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and reporting on the performance of pressure control systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertaking corrosion monitoring of equipment and pipework and provide reports&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Pipelines Maintenance Craftsperson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responsible for the maintenance and protection of the gas transportation pipelines and associated connecting plant and equipment to ensure the safe operation of pipelines and prevent damage from third parties. These are specialist maintenance services that may include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Under pressure drilling, flow stopping, fabrication, testing, in-line inspection, re-compression and valve repair to facilitate safe and efficient networks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Installing, maintaining, monitoring&amp;nbsp;and reporting on corrosion prevention systems on pressurised gas pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitoring works adjacent to high pressure pipelines and take action to prevent damage&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Locating and marking the route of high pressure pipelines&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Response Craftsperson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responsible for attending reported gas emergencies to safeguard persons and property. This includes dealing with reported gas escapes both inside and outside of customers’ properties and responding to reports of carbon monoxide leakage.
