  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the aerospace, aviation, automotive, defence, logistics, pharmaceutical, energy, food and drink, and wider advanced manufacturing and engineering sectors which utilise automated equipment with integrated systems and interfaces, where the equipment contains a blend of technologies such as mechanical, electrical, electronic and control, and fluid power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure that plant and equipment perform to the required standard to facilitate targets regarding safety, quality, delivery, availability and cost within the aerospace, aviation, automotive, logistics, defence and wider advanced manufacturing and engineering sectors. Multi-skilled mechatronics maintenance technicians carry out a broad range of activities which may include installation, testing, fault finding, rectification, modifications and the on-going planned maintenance of complex automated equipment. This requires the application of a blend of skills, knowledge and occupational behaviours across the electrical, electronic, mechanical, fluid power and control systems disciplines. They prepare for the maintenance activity and inform stakeholders of work status. They also complete documentation, handover work, set up their work area and are required to be competent in safe engineering practices for their own safety and those around them. They may be required to work shifts, to work at height and in confined spaces, as well as dealing with equipment which may contain high voltages, high pressures, ionising radiation and other hazards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of potential stake holders and others such as other technicians, engineering leaders, production operators, production leaders, business managers, customers, contractors, external agencies and members of the public. They may work in a range of environments including factories, hangers and workshops, as well as outside. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake within the limits of their personal authority, whilst complying with national and international legislation, civil or military regulatory and organisational requirements. All work must comply with health and safety legislation, environmental legislation and the employers own specific rules and guidance. They carry out complex maintenance activities on high value equipment across a wide range of equipment types and are responsible for the health and safety of themselves, their colleagues and others who may be affected by the work. They are required to complete tasks within defined timescales. They need to work autonomously, professionally and responsibly to regulatory and organisational requirements. Depending on the organisation they may be required to work on their own or as part of a team. They are responsible for the correct use and fitness for purpose of tools and equipment, and for maintaining their own continued professional development.&lt;/p&gt;",
