  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering sector and is core to the operation and maintenance of district heat networks. A district heat network is a system which generates and supplies low carbon heat, generated in a centralised location, through a system of insulated pipes to residential and commercial heat customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technicians will be responsible for the operation, planned maintenance and reactive repair of all equipment relevant to the network. This will involve attending customer properties - both residential and commercial, as well as distribution substations and energy centres, generating heat and often electricity. The role can involve working under pressure and to tight time constraints, such as when responding to energy outages where hundreds of people may be temporarily without heat supply. Technicians may also be required to support project improvement and specialist works, for example, acting as the company representative on the ground, controlling and supporting subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians will typically specialise in one of two roles with different technologies specific to each:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Residential systems specialist - working in customers&#39; homes to service, maintain and attend breakdowns of the customer heat interface unit, which provides the end customer with their heating and hot water supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Distribution systems specialist – working in distribution substations and energy centres to service, maintain and attend breakdowns of the distribution plant responsible for pumping hot water around the network. Typical equipment would include pumps, strainers, heat exchangers, expansion vessels, pressurisation units and control valves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians interacts with a wide variety of people. Externally, this includes customers living in their homes and professionals in the commercial spaces supplied with low carbon heat from the network. Local management and concierge teams will also often be present on the various sites, requiring regular communication of major works being undertaken. When in contact with customers district heat technicians represent their company and company values at all times. Internally, they work with, and have support from, fellow technicians in their own and the wider teams within the company. Day to day, when out on site, they often work alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians are responsible for completing all operation and maintenance tasks to a high standard, whether planned, corrective or reactive. An accurate, clear and concise record of all works will be required. Technicians typically report directly to a site manager, operations manager or maintenance manager. They are often required to be fully mobile with a vehicle provided by the company.&lt;/p&gt;",
