  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in the Electronic Systems sector.&#160; Electronic Systems are found in all parts of the economy: consumer electronics, automotive, defence, healthcare/medicine, digital/media/communications, robotics, Artificial Intelligence and the manufacturing industries.&#160; &#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is technical engineering leadership of complex Electronic Systems projects from conception through the whole design-implement-operation life cycle to obsolescence.&#160; They initiate and lead technical change, deliver innovative solutions, direct resources, manage teams and mentor junior colleagues in all areas related to Electronic System projects.&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of both internal and external stakeholders. Internally these would include members of inter-disciplinary project teams, engineers from other disciplines, general managers and the senior leadership of their organisation. Externally they would include customers, suppliers, academia, certification organisations, professional bodies, trade associations and regulatory authorities. Typically, they work in an office environment but they could also work in a manufacturing or test facility and at customer sites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for making important engineering decisions relating to Electronics Systems, mitigating technical risk and controlling engineering resources.&#160; The Electronic Systems Principal Engineer operates with considerable autonomy, as an acknowledged expert and will most likely have experience across all project lifecycle phases. They are fully accountable to senior executives, depending upon the size of the organisation, for schedule, budget and personnel management aspects of significant projects and for managing trade-offs between technical and other factors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;They are responsible for ensuring complex technical solutions are robust, innovative and in line with customer expectations. They may hold formal delegated authority for engineering decisions within their organisation. They are concerned with the development of other engineering and technical staff involved with Electronic Systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
