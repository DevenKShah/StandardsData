  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in every aspect of life, undertaking independent engineering inspections across all industries and premises. Engineer Surveyors are responsible for inspecting a wide variety of equipment in workplaces such as football stadiums, the space industry, music events, the film industry, dockyards as well as factories, shops, quarries, hospitals and schools.&lt;br /&gt;They are responsible for the inspection of millions of items of equipment every year from eyebolts to tower cranes, coffee boilers to steam trains and electrical installations, lifts and escalators and construction equipment. They are usually employed by inspection companies but are not restricted to this type of employer. Engineer Surveyors make up around 3000 of the UK workforce. Most engineering inspectors will already have a background in engineering before they join the profession and will typically have prior experience including a minimum of a level 3 qualification and a minimum of 3 years relevant experience.. The broad purpose of the occupation is to keep people safe, by carrying out engineering inspections to ensure safe continued use of the equipment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineer Surveyor&#39;s work is ‘hands-on’. This occupation requires practical experience, technical ability, strong customer communication skills and the confidence to make professional judgements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work carried out by Engineer Surveyor&#39;s is known as a &quot;thorough examinations&quot; and most of the major employers of Engineer Surveyors across the UK cover thorough examination and Inspection on the following classes of equipment:&lt;br /&gt;•Lift Installations&lt;br /&gt;•Crane Machinery&lt;br /&gt;•Pressure Equipment&lt;br /&gt;•Power Press/Hazardous Machinery&lt;br /&gt;•Electrical Equipment and Installations&lt;br /&gt;•Local Exhaust Ventilation Systems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most thorough examinations and inspections are undertaken due to a requirement of legislation or code of practice. This includes defect identification, risk analysis and report writing to advise and enable the client to comply with their legal responsibilities, however Engineer Surveyors do not carry out any necessary maintenance work that they identify as needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineer Surveyors are usually home-based, where they plan their work and compile reports, so they are usually provided with all of the equipment needed to operate effectively, such as a computer, mobile telephone and personal protective equipment. Many employers provide for or supply a company vehicle. Daily duties require Engineer Surveyors to travel to client sites and carry out thorough examinations within an allocated geographical area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portable devices are often used at the point of activity to prepare reports and obtain technical guidance/procedures or technical specifications for reference during the inspections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be physically and technically demanding and may require working at height or working in confined spaces, lifting and climbing in both hot and cold environments. It could involve exposure to noise and dust. No two days are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineer Surveyors are self-motivated, and able to achieve targets working to tight timeframes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineer Surveyors are allocated a portfolio of work by their employer relating to specific types of equipment that they are authorised to inspect, this is known as their &quot;core range&quot;. Where clients request inspection of plant/machinery/equipment not included within their restricted core range, they notify a Technical Specialist responsible for that type of plant/machinery/equipment so it can be inspected by someone with the correct level of competence. It is important that they understand the boundaries of their authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Engineer Surveyor must be able to carry out all of the core duties listed below and also demonstrate the specialist requirements in ONE of the following job specific roles.&lt;br /&gt;Option 1 Engineer Surveyor (Mechanical) – Will specialise in mechanical plant/equipment/machinery which typically may include pressure vessels, power presses and lifting equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Option 2: Engineer Surveyor (Electrical) - Will specialise in electrical plant/equipment/machinery which typically may include electrical fixed wiring, portable devices and electrical inspections in hazardous areas such as petrol stations.. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with clients at every level within an organisation, from maintenance personnel to operations managers and directors. They typically interact remotely (rather than face-to-face) with colleagues as part of a team, reporting to a regional team leader. They may be required to interact with Government authorities such as the Health and Safety Executive and local authorities. They are usually required to communicate with technical specialists for guidance and support relating to the specific plant or equipment being inspected.. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for - Ensuring legal compliance in accordance with workplace legislation with respect to inspection activities.&lt;br /&gt;- Maintaining technical competence in their field of expertise.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeping themselves safe.&lt;br /&gt;- Keeping others safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore this is a very responsible role..&lt;/p&gt;",
