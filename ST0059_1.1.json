  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Boatbuilders build boats such as yachts, workboats and superyachts and/or refit and repair existing boats. Boats may be made of composites, metals or wood so a boatbuilder can work with and understand the capabilities of a variety of materials. They can read and interpret engineering and technical drawings to produce moulds, jigs, plugs and templates to create complex shapes using a variety of measuring equipment, machines and hand tools. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They manufacture and assemble components that form the structure of a boat as well as the interior and exterior fit out. They will be expected to work both individually and as part of a team. They understand and comply with organisational and statutory safety including sustainability requirements and can work with minimum supervision. They are responsible for the quality and accuracy of their work and are good communicators and problem solvers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Boatbuilders typically work with associated trades such as Marine Engineers and have a strong understanding of the marine industry. Upon successful completion of their apprenticeship, the individual will be multi-skilled and thus capable of adapting to changing demands as boats become more complex, and new materials and methods are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 659px;&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Requirements: skills and knowledge&lt;/caption&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th

This timescale may reduce if an apprentice is part-qualified on entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English and Maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the End-Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to professional registration and progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will be recognised by Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology (IMarEST) at ‘Engineering Technician’ level on successful completion of the apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;",
