A Lean Manufacturing Operative will be responsible for maintaining Health and Safety requirements at all times e.g. wearing correct Personal Protective Equipment (P.P.E.) correct use of equipment and tooling, safe stopping and resetting of machinery, maintain an organised work area e.g. 5s (Sifting, Sorting, Sweeping, Spick &amp;amp; Span and Sustain) ensuring the safe disposal of waste in line with environmental systems and regulatory requirements (ISO 14001). They will be required to contribute, develop and support improvement in the manufacturing operation using continuous improvement methods, kaizen tools, process &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;visualisation using lean principles and problem solving tools and techniques. They will be responsible for carrying out quality checks throughout the manufacturing operations to ensure quality is built in and that any defects or concerns are highlighted and dealt with in line with relevant quality standards (ISO 9002).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will work closely with stakeholders and will have clear reporting lines to ensure appropriate escalation e.g. teamleader, line leader, process leader, supervisor etc. should problems occur within the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of the job titles from across the manufacturing sector that would be covered within this standard are: &lt;/strong&gt;Team Member Production&lt;strong&gt;; &lt;/strong&gt;Manufacturing Production Operative; Manufacturing Assembly Operative; Manufacturing Inspection/Quality Assurance Operative; Manufacturing Logistics Operative; Manufacturing Material Handling Operative; Manufacturing Process/Finishing Operative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Lean Manufacturing Operative must have the core requirements below and demonstrate the specialist requirements in ONE job specific role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;: A Lean Manufacturing Operative will have the following knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/strong&gt;: Relevant statutory, organisational and health and safety regulations relating to lean manufacturing operations and safe practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental:&lt;/strong&gt; Compliance procedures/systems in line with regulatory requirements e.g. ISO 14001 &lt;span&gt;or other relevant environmental standards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Production:&lt;/strong&gt; Their individual roles and responsibilities within the organisation and the flexibility required to deliver products to meet customers costs/delivery targets/requirements e.g. Just in time (JIT)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean Manufacturing Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Manufacturing standard operation procedures (SOPs) adherence and development of lean processes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Process equipment monitoring, data collection, error proofing and operating procedures e.g. ISO 9002 or other relevant quality standards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem Solving:&lt;/strong&gt; The tools and methods of effective problem solving using data, reports and documents to resolve production related issues e.g. A3 report, graphs, matrices and escalate concerns &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Improvement: &lt;/strong&gt;How to study and identify ways to improve the safety, quality, cost or process efficiency using lean manufacturing tools e.g. kaizen &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication: &lt;/strong&gt;How to share information using a range of methods within the manufacturing environment e.g. oral, written, electronic, information boards, visual displays&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work Place O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rganisation:&lt;/strong&gt; How to maintain a safe and efficient work site through work place organisation e.g. 5s and process ownership&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; A Lean Manufacturing Operative will have the skill and understanding to:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health &amp;amp; Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Work safely at all times, complying with health and safety legislation, regulations, and other relevant guidelines.
