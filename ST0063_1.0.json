  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ob description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A building services design technician provides assistance to engineers and other construction professionals in the development of cost effective technical and sustainable design solutions involving the &#160;production of three dimensional models, calculations, specifications, reports and drawings taking into account, where appropriate, pre-fabrication techniques. Their work typically includes systems such as renewable technologies, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, drainage, lighting, power, controls and lifts. Buildings and infrastructure take on many forms from newly built facilities to the refurbishment of premises for every sector of industry. As design technicians they could be working under supervision in a design consultancy, a contractor or a manufacturing company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A design technician&#39;s work could also involve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analysis – using appropriate software and simulation systems to solve technical problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Project delivery – contributing to planning, managing work schedules, budgets and deadlines working as a member of a team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Site engineering - operating quality systems and Health, Safety and Risk Management procedures, progress monitoring, see that installations generally comply with the design intent, responding to site queries, commissioning and post occupancy evaluations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ntry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will set their own entry requirements, but apprenticeship candidates will typically have at least 5 GCSEs at Grades A*-C including Maths (Grade B), English and Science or their equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers who recruit candidates without English or Maths at Grade C or above must ensure that the candidate achieves a level 2 equivalent standard prior to taking the end point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration for this apprenticeship is 36 months but this will depend on the previous experience of the apprentice and access to opportunities to gain the full range of competence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Apprenticeship. &#160;On completion the apprentice will have satisfied the requirements for registration as an Engineering Technician by the relevant professional engineering institution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Apprenticeship Standard will be reviewed after 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Building Services Design Technician will know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The different techniques and methods used to design building engineering services projects. &lt;/strong&gt;This includes an understanding of how technologies, components and requirements are converted into building engineering systems designs including the use of relevant standard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The appropriate scientific, technical and engineering principles relating to the design of building engineering services projects. &lt;/strong&gt;This includes an understanding of the mathematical, scientific and engineering techniques required to support the design and construction processes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to work effectively and contribute to engineering solutions by the correct use of resources and time. &lt;/strong&gt;This includes an understanding of project management systems, tools and techniques as they are applied to the design and construction process&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to communicate effectively using a range of techniques&lt;/strong&gt;.
