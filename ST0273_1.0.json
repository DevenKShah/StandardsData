This usually involves helping them solve a challenge of some kind, such as how to grow their business, how to make it more efficient or how to organise and structure itself in a different way. Some specialist consultancies have a particular focus – for example, how to write proposals for new work, or how to change an organisation or how to develop their workforce. Others are more generalist and you could work across several different types of project. Working on client site away from your office is a possibility, while hours are varied and often depend on the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tasks can be varied. You might be involved in conducting research, analysing and interpreting data or be responsible for organising the logistics of the project. As you develop and progress, you might be involved in contributing to report writing which uses statistical evidence to support recommendations and conclusions, or support the creation of slide decks to deliver key messages to clients. You might also become more focused on a particular type of service offering (financial, strategic, operational, etc.) or industry (financial services, public sector, telecommunications etc.).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A competent Junior Management Consultant, on completion of the Apprenticeship Standard, will meet the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 137px;&quot; width=&quot;137&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 321px;&quot; width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wha&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;137&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business environment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Know the different industry sectors, the types of organisations within these sectors, and how a management consultancy can support their needs&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;137&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Management consultancy business&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Know how a consultancy typically works, how it manages relationships with its&#160;clients, and understand the ethical considerations it operates under&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;137&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business finances&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Know key financial ratios and performance indicators (such as balance sheets and cash flow forecasts) that are necessary to effectively assess an organisation’s financial health&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;137&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Project management&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;321&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Know how a project moves through its lifecycle of planning, design, development, testing, deployment and evaluation.

However, firms often support the continuous development of their consultants and may provide sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Upon completion of the programme, an apprentice might specialise in a particular type of consultancy or industry or remain more generalist. The skills that are developed often lead to employment in organisations within a certain industry, while some consultants who are established go on to run their own consultancy practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The standard will be initially reviewed every three years to ensure it reflects employer&lt;/p&gt;",
