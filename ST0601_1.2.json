  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A prosthetist and orthotist&amp;nbsp;is a registered clinician. This unique occupation provides the opportunity to practise in two areas of healthcare. Most will specialise in prosthetics or orthotics; a small number continue in both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Prosthetists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis and engineering solutions to service users with limb(s) loss. They are trained in mechanics, biomechanics, and material science along with anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. They are able to design, provide and modify prostheses that replicate the structural or functional characteristics of a service user&#39;s absent limb(s). They provide care to service users with congenital (from birth) limb loss, as well as those with limb loss due to conditions including diabetes, reduced vascularity, infection and trauma. &lt;strong&gt;Orthotists&lt;/strong&gt; Provide gait (walking) analysis and engineering solutions to service users with problems of the neuro, muscular and skeletal systems. They consider a range of factors when assessing service users, including mechanics, biomechanics, material science, anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology. They design and provide orthoses that modify the structural or functional characteristics of a service user&#39;s neuro, muscular and skeletal systems, enabling them to mobilise, eliminate gait deviations (improve walking), reduce falls, reduce pain, prevent and facilitate healing of ulcers and prevent physical deformities from progressing. They fit and modify orthoses and are accountable and responsible for the impact of any changes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prosthetists and orthotists manage their own caseloads, working across all age ranges and with a wide variety of conditions, often providing lifetime care. Whilst acting as autonomous practitioners, with leadership and management responsibilities, they work collaboratively as a key part of a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) to provide holistic care through the provision of rehabilitation and long-term care. Prosthetists and orthotists work for both the NHS and independent companies. &lt;a&gt;Prosthetists and orthotists demonstrate confidence, compassion, competency and effective judgement about risk and are responsible and accountable for their decisions.&lt;/a&gt; A prosthetist and orthotist instruct and guide their technicians in the specification and manufacture of prostheses and orthoses. They also advise them in matters of interaction and care when the technicians are dealing directly with service users; for example, for repairs. They use current evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of their practice, with the aim of continually improving outcomes for service users. They are responsible for ensuring their own knowledge and skills are current and support the development of others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, a prosthetist and orthotist interacts with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Service users, their families and carers in clinical settings, such as hospitals, community clinics, care homes and general practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prosthetist and orthotist technicians&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other health and social care professionals; for example, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and care workers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Administrative and clerical staff providing support to the prosthetics and orthotics team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
