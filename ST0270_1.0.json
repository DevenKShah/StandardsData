The dispensation will run indefinitely until all apprentices registered to ST0270/AP01/V1.0 and ST0270/V1.1 only, are complete. The dispensation may be withdrawn if no longer necessary. End-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported, and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.\nThe key changes are:\n\nTo allow assessment method 2, ‘observation with questioning’ to be delivered in a simulated learning environment. The assessment of working at height safely will be evidenced in the portfolio as part of S1 and confirmed in the interview.\n",
