  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;1. Occupation:&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Project managers are responsible to the project sponsor/owner for the end-to-end delivery of a project or a subset of a project dependent on the complexity and criticality to the business. They have responsibility for delivering the project in line with defined objectives, taking decisions to manage stakeholder expectations by leading a multi-skilled, cross-disciplinary team to deliver the project to time, cost and quality requirements. Using their unique knowledge, skills and leadership behaviours project managers will manage the social, legal and environmental implications of their project. In addition, they will manage a variety of interfaces with the organisational entities involved in the project, reporting to the project sponsor and working within the requirements of the programme and portfolio as appropriate. A project manager must also have the competencies to contribute to benefits management and realisation, consolidating appropriate metrics to report thus ensuring that identified business benefits are achieved.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve these objectives, project managers will apply appropriate governance and project management methods and techniques to initiate and execute projects, interfacing with other projects within larger project programmes to meet the strategic objectives of the organisation. They will have an appreciation of programme management techniques and an understanding of how projects are managed within a larger programme.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;These skills and behaviours require the project manager to be an effective leader of change, able to develop a group of direct, sub-contract, or temporarily aligned resources into a coherent team that delivers the project objectives. They will have management responsibilities, including resource budget planning, and may also hold people development accountabilities. They will have an understanding of the diversity of roles and challenges facing project professionals and an appreciation of tailoring needs, recognising the different contexts and technical requirements that exist in different industry sectors and/or organisation sizes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Projects span public, private and third sectors in industries as diverse as banking, insurance, government, healthcare, retail and transport.
