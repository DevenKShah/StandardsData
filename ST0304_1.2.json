  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Police Constables (PCs) are found in the Home Office police forces and also in some non-Home Office police forces. They predominantly work in, though are not restricted to, the communities within each of their designated force geographical boundaries, to use their authority for the protection of life and property, maintenance or order, prevention of crime and prosecution of offenders. PCs have a unique status, as Crown Servants and/or warranted officers; each sworn constable is an independent legal official with each officer having personal responsibility for their actions or inactions. Police forces differ in regional size, organisational headcount and the population that they each serve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to prevent and detect crime in compliance with authorised professional practice (APP), working in partnership on a day-to-day basis with local communities, stakeholders and colleagues in order to promote law and order, reduce the fear of crime, provide reassurance and build confidence to improve the quality of life for citizens. In undertaking their role whilst traditionally working shifts predominantly in the public arena, PCs are required to meet and maintain the highest of professional standards by conducting all actions in a legal, balanced, proportionate and justifiable manner to uphold the law and achieve the best outcomes for society when necessary by bringing offenders to justice across a wide range of situations or incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In their daily work a PC may interact with colleagues at all levels of seniority within their organisation. Outside of their organisation&amp;nbsp;they will liaise and work with external stakeholders at all levels, within networks and institutions, ranging from those in other police and judicial and social organisations, such as social services, NHS, crown prosecution service, as well as other community-based groups or organisations such as schools, victim and welfare support groups and members of the public, both collectively and&amp;nbsp;individually.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;A PC in undertaking their duties either independently or within a small team, will need to maintain an operational level of fitness,&amp;nbsp;use emotional intelligence and appropriate communication skills, use proportionate levels of force, behave in a consistent and ethical manner whilst having the ability to&amp;nbsp;analyse and resolve rapidly evolving events.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;PCs exercise wide-ranging powers to maintain the peace and uphold the law across&amp;nbsp;complex and diverse communities. They will provide an initial autonomous response to incidents, which can be complex, confrontational and life-threatening, to bring about the best possible outcomes. They must justify and personally account for their actions through differing legal frameworks including courts, while also under the scrutiny of the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Competent PCs gather information and intelligence in order to conduct risk and threat analysis across wide-ranging, multi-faceted situations. These can include investigating incidents and crimes, handling suspects, managing searches, crime scenes and all types of evidence. They will work safely and lawfully, intelligently applying a wide range and depth of general and specialist skills, knowledge and behaviours to many different and increasingly complex policing contexts to confidently deal with modern day policing issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Increasingly PCs are individually responsible for determining, applying and evaluating practice, based on the best available evidence. Known as evidence-based policing, this will at times involve developing localised strategic partnerships to problem-solve, engage with, reassure and support organisations, groups and individuals across diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Whilst not typically being responsible for departmental budgets, they need an awareness of resource and demand issues that may be present within policing, as well as looking to use sustainable practices, including IT based ones, to protect themselves, others and their environment.&lt;/p&gt;",
