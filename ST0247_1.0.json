set the selection criteria for their apprentices. Most candidates will have achieved grade C or above in English and mathematics at GCSE level prior to commencement of apprenticeship. Most candidates will also hold A-levels or existing relevant Level 3 qualifications or equivalent. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On completion, apprentices will hold a higher national diploma or a foundation degree or an honours degree in a science or technology discipline relevant to their job role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;English &amp;amp; Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice will have a depth and breadth of English and mathematics that allow them to operate successfully within their role. This may be met through entry criteria determined by the employer or qualifications and training within the apprenticeship. However, on completion all apprentices will have minimum Level 2 qualifications in English and mathematics. Some employers may mandate training or qualifications at Level 3 in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Professional Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship is recognised by the relevant professional bodies at Registered Scientist (RSci) level, for which there is a requirement that the scientist will participate in subsequent continuing professional development on completion of the apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Level of apprenticeship&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Level 5&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review Date&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard will be reviewed by employers in March 2018.&lt;/p&gt;",
