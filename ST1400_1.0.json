  "entryRequirements": "&lt;p&gt;There are no character and suitability requirements for undertaking the apprenticeship. However, a Candidate is advised that the CLSB assesses character and suitability when a Costs Lawyer applies to become authorised and regulated by the CLSB under the Legal Services Act 2007 (Costs Lawyer practising certificate). Therefore, before starting the Costs Lawyer apprenticeship it is suggested that a Candidate considers these requirements. If a Candidate is unsure about the assessment of character and suitability before commencing the CLCA or during the CLCA, the Candidate is advised to contact the CLSB at enquiries@clsb.info for clarification on the impact of this as a positive answer is not always a bar to a practising certificate being issued.&lt;/p&gt;",

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in any size of legal organisation in the public, private or third sector. Costs lawyers can help clients with legal costs in legal fields such as personal injury, criminal, court of protection, family, public law or contract law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to advise and represent clients in regard to legal costs law and practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Costs Lawyers are qualified experts in legal costs. They can advise clients on issues like litigation costs, the cost of legal services, such as, solicitors’ or barristers’ fees, and legal aid costs. They have a right to appear in court on behalf of their clients on matters relating to costs. Legal costs might include: the fees that the client pays for legal advice; the cost of bringing or defending court proceedings; costs incurred by other parties to court proceedings that a client might have to pay if they lose and costs they may have to pay if they win. These costs can be high and the law on legal costs is complex. Costs Lawyers can therefore represent their client&#39;s interests and help them make informed decisions. A Costs Lawyer may be involved in litigation. Usually this will be in the context of a civil court case, but Costs Lawyers also act in criminal cases where costs are payable by the prosecution. They can advise on the amount of costs that are likely to be incurred in the litigation or prepare details of costs that a client has already incurred where they are entitled to reimbursement from another party. They can also advise on costs a client is required to pay to another party and challenge those costs where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Costs Lawyer may advise where a client has concerns about the fees they have been charged by a legal professional, such as a barrister or solicitor. A Costs Lawyer can also provide advice at the time a client enters into a contract with a legal adviser, including “no win no fee” arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Costs Lawyers are qualified professionals that must meet certain professional standards set by the Costs Lawyer Standards Board (CLSB). A person does not need to be qualified and regulated before they can advise consumers about matters relating to legal costs. Unregulated costs advisers are sometimes called costs draftsmen, or similar terms. Costs Lawyers can do certain things that unregulated advisers can’t do and using a regulated Costs Lawyer offers special protections for clients. Costs Lawyers are authorised to do three reserved legal activities related to legal costs: they have the right to conduct litigation, represent their clients in court and administer oaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate legal team, legally and non-legally trained stakeholders and customers who use their services. They may also interact with government departments, financial institutions, regulators and professional bodies. They may attend relevant Courts and Tribunals to represent their clients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring that all legal activities related to legal costs are carried out effectively and lawfully. They will carry out certain reserved activities that only a qualified and regulated lawyer is eligible to undertake. They provide an end-to-end specialist service for their clients. On qualification, a successful apprentice can apply to the Costs Lawyer Services Board for a practising certificate that enables them to carry out the following reserved legal activities under the Legal Services Act 2007.&lt;/p&gt;",
