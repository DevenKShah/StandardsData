  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the creative media industries. Junior production coordinators work as part of a production team delivering film, radio, audio, TV, digital content or animated series, commercials or in specialist post production departments. A junior production coordinator may be employed by television, film, digital, radio or audio production companies or VFX or post production facilities. They may work for a production, or a series of productions, seeing them through from pre-production through to post production, or through a specific part of the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to coordinate productions using specialist production management skills, knowledge and experience. A junior production coordinator can work across all genres in film, television, digital, radio, audio or commercials; they may work in the production office, on set, in a studio or on location, in the UK or internationally. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with and supports the production coordinator, production manager or VFX producer and the wider production or post production teams and with clients and crew.&#160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for supporting and delivering the operational elements of productions in film, TV, commercials, short form production, radio, audio, post production, animation and VFX. This may include logistics, finance, personnel, equipment or content for productions, both on and off set, studio or on location. Specific roles and responsibilities may vary from production to production depending on the genre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a core and options standard, to reflect the varied roles that come under the production coordinator occupation in the creative industries.
