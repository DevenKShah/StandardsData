  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in non Home Office Police Forces. These include, but are not restricted to, the Royal Navy Police, the Royal Military Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence Police. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide policing and or investigative activity, with some forces having specific responsibility for protecting the personnel, assets and/or infrastructure of their organisation and that of the public. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the public, their organisation management chain/chain of command, other colleagues who support policing activities and other Law Enforcement Agencies in the UK and potentially overseas. The employee will conduct both internal and external activities regardless of the prevailing weather conditions. Additionally the employee maybe be expected to participate in a shift system which will include working during unsociable hours such night time and weekend duties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for proactive and reactive policing so employees can expect to undertake a wide variety of duties to deliver a law enforcement effect within the scope of their jurisdiction and organisational outputs. They will be expected to use initiative in assessing situations and take responsibility for implementing appropriate processes to manage them. These situations could range from routine, prescriptive, well defined activities through to the management of complex scenarios which are uncertain and less familiar. Regardless of the nature of the situation the individual will be accountable for their actions which must be compliant with policy and legislation, documented and justified. Tasks undertaken will include, but are not limited to, patrolling, both on foot and by vehicle; conducting risk assessments; ensuring safety for all involved; preserving crime scenes; conducting arrests, interviewing individuals, victims, witnesses and suspects; preparing and presenting reports in a range of judicial processes; assisting other Law Enforcement Agencies as required. In the course of routine duties some employees will carry, and where the situation requires, deploy firearms. Yet again this activity must be compliant and justified. The importance and responsibility of the employeeâ€™s role cannot be underestimated, and their actions may impact on the lives of those within their jurisdiction. Compliance with overarching legislation, including but not restricted to the Human Rights Act and the Victims Code, is therefore of paramount importance. Although the employee will receive strategic direction and supervision, they will be individually responsible for, and work autonomously, during the tactical delivery of their activity.&lt;/p&gt;",
