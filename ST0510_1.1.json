  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Social Work is an exciting and fulfilling international profession. Social Workers work in partnership with adults, children, carers, and families in a range of different settings to support and promote positive change in people&#39;s lives in order to improve their wellbeing and independence, and to reduce risk and harm.&#160; They protect and promote human rights and strive for social justice.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social Workers work within statutory and legislative frameworks, using their professional judgement and building relationships with a variety of individuals and communities, as well as with a wide range of other professionals and agencies. They assess, plan, implement and evaluate complex situations, which requires an ability to critically reflect and make decisions within a clear professional code of ethics.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in social care services, health services and the voluntary and private sector. Social Workers can work in children’s services or adult social care, and can specialise in areas such as mental health, learning&#160; disabilities, substance misuse or hospital work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers include local authorities, health organisations including the NHS, voluntary organisations, charities, and private businesses.&#160; Some Social Workers work independently, setting up their own companies to contract for work. Examples would include carrying out independent fostering assessment or providing practice education for student Social Workers and apprentices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Registered Social Workers engage in protecting individuals from harm, abuse, neglect and exploitation. They work in a way which is compassionate and takes account of all aspects of the individual’s life - ensuring their voice is central to decision making. They use their professional expertise to work, assess, plan, implement, evaluate and intervene putting the needs of people first and demonstrate a clear commitment to anti-racist and anti-oppressive practice .&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout their career, they are responsible for ensuring their Continuing Professional Development and will be expected to demonstrate leadership in their work. All Social Workers must register with the professional regulator and adhere to their professional standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with individuals, families, communities, and a wide range of other professionals and agencies including but not limited to education, health, housing, care service providers, police and probation. Within their own organisation they interact with the managers they report to and depending on the organisation Heads of Service, Occupational Therapists, support and administrative personnel, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working with a number of people or families at any one time.&#160; Day-to-day work involves assessing people’s needs, strengths and wishes, working with individuals and families directly to help them make changes and resolve difficulties, organising support, making recommendations or referrals to other services and agencies, and keeping detailed records.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social Workers are usually supervised by a Team Manager. If their Team Manager is not a Social Worker, they must receive professional supervision from a registered Social Worker. Social Workers can be responsible for managing support staff and other staff, both qualified and unqualified, with less experience than themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social Workers are responsible for making evidence-based judgements and making recommendations.&#160; They must do this within the relevant statutory and legislative frameworks, and practice guidance. Social Workers receive regular supervision to support their professional development.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many Social Worker roles require a driving licence; however this will depend on the setting and geographic location.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Social Workers require an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a Level 6 apprenticeship.&#160; However, there is an option for the learning to be delivered at an undergraduate or postgraduate level.&#160; The level will be dependent on the employer’s arrangements with the training provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
