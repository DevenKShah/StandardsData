To meet these requirements many organisations will have dedicated risk and compliance departments that are experts in the relevant legislation and regulator requirements. They provide proactive support and guidance to the business areas to ensure that the organisation meets this wide range of requirements, balanced against achieving appropriate customer outcomes. &amp;nbsp;In some organisations, this expertise may be embedded in the business areas themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Senior compliance specialist and Senior risk specialist&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the risk and compliance function of a specific organisation, the role of the Senior compliance and risk specialist is to provide high quality input and advice to the business in their specialist area(s) of expertise e.g. risk, financial crime, compliance, modelling and analysing data. This is likely to include dealing with complex problems, implementing new legal and regulatory requirements, working with senior managers in the organisation. The role requires sound ethical standards, significant technical expertise, together with the capability to influence senior members of the organisation as there can often be differing views on the appropriate action to take.

They provide proactive support and guidance to internal business areas to ensure that the organisation meets the requirements, balanced against achieving appropriate customer outcomes. In some organisations, this expertise may be embedded in the business areas themselves. Specialists may work in small, medium or large firms and increasingly may be working from home or with some access to office facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Risk and compliance specialists operate in many sectors where regulation and legislation is evident, including banking and finance, gambling and gaming, healthcare, utilities and as consultants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide high quality input and advice to the business in their specialist area(s) of expertise. The specialist areas may include, risk, financial crime, compliance, modelling and analysing data, customer due diligence, cyber security, governance, anti-money laundering, Environmental, Social &amp;amp; Governance (ESG) and climate risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A senior compliance and risk specialist manages complex problems, implements any new legal and regulatory requirement and works with senior people in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As working from home becomes more common, proficiency in digital communications is a core requirement to communicate with the business and other members of the team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with senior personnel in their organisation and others who engage in risk-based activities. They are required to manage differing views and influence others to achieve collaborative solutions including regulators/ legislative experts/ policy staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for planning and developing courses of action to maintain risk and compliance in line with organisational risk appetite and regulatory requirements. They will also initiate and lead tasks and processes, taking responsibility, where relevant, for the work and roles of others and the allocation of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be a need to exercise broad autonomy and judgement adhering to ethical standards and applying technical expertise whilst applying deep underpinning knowledge of risk and compliance frameworks, policies, and procedures. This knowledge may cover compliance or risk functions or be a blend of both depending on the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The employee in this area of work has the capability to influence senior members of the organisation as there can often be differing views on the appropriate action to take. Employees will need to possess excellent communication and negotiation skills as well as resilience and persistence when ensuring policy and plans are implemented to conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
