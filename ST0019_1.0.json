In order to optimise success, candidates will typically possess four GCSEs B grade (or equivalent) or above on entry including English, Maths and a Science. &amp;nbsp;Apprentices without Level&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2 Maths and English must achieve this prior to taking the end – point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ation of Apprenticeship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 48 months, timescales may reduce if an apprentice has prior relevant qualifications/experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a period of foundation skills and technical knowledge development within a protected environment/or under close supervision in the workplace or area, all apprentices will be required to achieve the following qualification (working title - currently in development)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 2 Aerospace and Aviation (Foundation Competence)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a further period of skills and technical knowledge development all apprentices will be required to achieve the following qualifications/certification (working titles - currently in development)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 4 Aerospace and Aviation (Development Competence)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Certification against the EASA part 66 modules – B Licence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of the qualification/certification requirements in the foundation and development phases are mandatory outcomes for the completion and final certification of the Apprenticeship Standard. Each qualification has a core and options approach and employers will select the most applicable pathway and unit options to meet their business requirements. Further detail can be found in the Employer Occupational Brief which is an annex to the Assessment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be an assessment at the end of the development phase where the apprentice will need to demonstrate full competence against the qualification outcomes for knowledge, skills and behaviours, set out in the Standard and Employer Occupational Brief. On successful completion of the employer endorsement phase (sign off) apprentices will be then be put forward to be awarded their Apprenticeship completion certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge and vocational qualifications that meet national and/or regulatory requirements will be included on the Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship will be recognised by relevant Professional Engineering Institutions at the appropriate level of professional registration (EngTech). The apprentice will also have made a successful application for an EASA Part 66 category B Licence&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level and Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard is at Level 4 (equivalent to Higher National Diploma) and will be reviewed after three years to ensure it continues to meet employers’ requirements and provides the basis for progression to higher qualifications and or jo b roles.&lt;/p&gt;",
