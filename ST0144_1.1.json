  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in various industries processing or producing products. Employers range from small independent businesses to large multi-national corporations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship standard. Apprentices will complete the core requirements, plus one option:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Mobile plant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Static plant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of this occupation is to process raw material or waste into a high-quality product, often meeting a product specification. This product may be needed to meet global infrastructure requirements or to improve our environment. Material processing plant operators operate either fixed or mobile specialist plant equipment to a high standard, efficiently and safely complying with legislation, company policies and procedures. It is likely they will specialise on one item of plant and will operate that equipment to a high degree of efficiency. However in some cases operatives may go on to learn to operate multiple items of plant equipment in the production process. In this occupation the operative can process a diverse range of products for various end uses and related manufacturing, such as ready mixed concrete, building and construction products, architectural aesthetic products, landscaping products, waste and recycled products, dimensional stone, cut and carved stone, marine aggregates, mortar, asphalt, cement, wood and timber products, precast or prestressed concrete products, ceramics, metallic, non-metallic or ferrous or non-ferrous alloys. Duties include carrying out proactive and routine maintenance inspections of fixed or mobile specialist plant equipment. They are expected to report plant defects, monitor the quality and specification of the products produced, conduct risk assessments and work to safe operating procedures, communicate with all stakeholders in a busy environment, they will be able to demonstrate a good product knowledge and a strong discipline towards safety, overall health, and sustainability. Employers encourage diversity so operators will be expected to promote the business culture towards a diverse workforce, supporting colleagues in all aspects of overall wellbeing. The associated job roles work with specialist plant and equipment that can be fixed or mobile each capable of moving and processing up to several thousands of tonnes of materials every day. Progression routes from this role can lead to team leaders, shift or site supervisors and managers and operation managers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee&#160; in this occupation interacts with a team of operatives in various aspects of production or process. The operatives will work mainly in an outdoor environment in all seasons and weathers in a diverse range of environments from urban sites to countryside operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for processing materials or producing high quality end products for customers, often meeting a strict specification. Operators can work alone as well as in a team and they will work with a level of autonomy operating expensive equipment. Employees are expected to have a high degree of self-discipline, safety first focussed and be able to constructively challenge anyone who may be acting unsafe.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
