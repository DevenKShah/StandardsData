  "standardInformation": "&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The Community Activator Coach Standard will underpin occupations such as an Activator, Sports Coach, Activity Leader, Community Worker or Outreach Officer. These roles are predominantly employed by sport for social change charities; SMEs who operate in the sport and physical activity sector; local authorities; sports clubs; leisure centres; youth work agencies; housing associations and outdoor education centres and are deployed to primarily work with inactive groups of people. The wider sport and activity sector plays an important role in improving the health and wellbeing of the nation and provides a positive environment which supports (especially young) people to grow and develop through sport and physical activity. The Community Activator Coach promotes, delivers and coaches fun, inclusive and engaging activities that help whole communities to change their behaviour, adopt and keep to a physically active lifestyle. Community Activator Coaches are more than activity and sports leaders – they understand communities and customers. They will be equipped with the specialist knowledge needed to effectively work with one customer group (such as inactive teenagers) but also be knowledgeable about other inactive customer groups whom they may be expected to work with on occasions. When competent they will be experienced working with a range of different communities and all kinds of customers who are likely to be defined as inactive, sedentary or not doing enough physical activity in their lives. They also know how to make communities and lives better through physical activity, organised play and sport. The Community Activator Coach will be a positive role model who builds good rapport with customers - especially those who are young, inactive, or from low-income and marginalised communities. The Community Activator Coach often works alongside youth workers, the police and community safety agencies to make neighbourhoods safer and works alongside health workers to make residents fitter and healthier. The role is a flexible one and individuals can expect to work varied and unsociable hours, including evenings, weekends and school holidays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3 class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Knowledge - The Community Activator Coach will:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Understand the benefits of physical activity and sport for individuals, families and communities, and know why adopting an active and healthy lifestyle is important.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Understand the basic principles of behavioural change when applied to sport and physical activity, and know how to keep customers active.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know the importance of credible customer insight - listening to customers and understanding their motivations - to shape provision and leadership style.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know the importance of effective leadership and coaching in the delivery of a physical activity or sports sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know the value of using informal spaces and ‘out of locality’ settings to encourage customers to develop the lifelong activity habit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Understand the role of the coach in developing effective motivational relationships, how to build rapport with customers and understand what good role models look like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Understand the tasks involved in delivering community level activation events and support their delivery, particularly in terms of providing equipment and activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know how to support customer welfare and where required, manage disruptive behaviours by individuals within the group setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know how to make best use of national and major events (for example the Commonwealth Games) to capture public imagination, raise activity levels and encourage community involvement in volunteering and social action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Know how to work with community organisations to run tailored neighbourhood events that make best use of local assets to bring people together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Understand the importance of accurate record keeping for monitoring and evaluation purposes;
