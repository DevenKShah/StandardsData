  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;LBSE Service Engineers will typically work on the employers premises under supervision and where appropriate and safe to do so work on their own initiative. They work on a diverse range of tasks and machinery, plant and equipment specific to their sector within the land-based engineering industry. For example these may include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preparation of new and second-hand machinery for sale or hire&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-delivery inspection of machinery carried out in accordance with manufacturer’s and employer’s procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Performing routine service and maintenance operations in accordance with manufacturer’s schedules and employer’s instructions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The preparation of equipment for repair for example, cleaning, dismantling and reassembly of machinery and their component parts, this may be carried out under supervision or in accordance with procedures or written briefs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conducting routine machine operation and systems testing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handing over machinery plant and equipment to the control and use of others in the workplace. For example a senior technician.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These operations typically take place under the supervision of a senior technician in the workplace or on the customer’s site, in which case work may be undertaken outdoors. The nature of the job role presents challenges ranging from routine maintenance to the repair of elementary mechanical faults. This requires a diverse blend of skills, industry underpinning knowledge and the disciplines required for environmental and safe working practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers set the selection criteria for their apprentices. Typically this will include English and mathematics GCSE’s at Grade C or equivalent. In addition it is desirable that the apprentice has a basic understanding of Information and Communication Technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 1 English and maths will need to achieve this level and take the tests for level 2 English and maths prior to taking the end point assessment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Service engineers will have a thorough knowledge and understanding of: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to comply with the Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work Act, Manual Handling regulations, the abrasive wheel regulations and the legislation relevant to the role of Service Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The company staff handbook, the chain of command, workplace procedures e.g. Daily time sheets, job cards, parts requisitions processes, use of pre-delivery procedures and maintenance schedules&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to record information, maintain accurate customer service records and communicate with customers and colleagues using verbal and handwritten methods whilst observing customer care practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Workshop practices, the identification and application of tools and equipment used in service and maintenance operations. This will typically include knowledge of the care and storage of tools and equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Methods of thermally and chemically joining metals and components. This knowledge will be used in the context of performing service and maintenance operations to machinery and equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The operating principles of machinery, plant and equipment within the chosen land-based service engineering sector.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Underpinning service, maintenance and repair principles and practices, typically including machinery and component conformity procedures, tolerances, pre-load, end float, backlash, component sealing, system bleeding, alignment, balance, calibration, removal of corroded components etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to access and interpret technical data relating to machinery and equipment service and maintenance operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to handover machinery, plant and equipment to the control and use of others in the workplace&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Emergency First Aid.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; The Service Engineer will have the ability to&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Select and apply appropriate tools and equipment, demonstrate dexterity, resourcefulness, and a professional approach to service engineering practice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain and conduct basic repairs and maintenance activities on power units, and power trains, mechanical equipment, plant and machinery and their associated systems and components either under supervision or following procedures and service schedules prepared by the manufacturer or employer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thermally and chemically join metals and materials.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Access and interpret technical data relating to service and maintenance operations in accordance with the manufacturer’s documentation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate with customers and colleagues expressing technical information in clear concise terms whilst demonstrating customer care principles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work efficiently both under supervision, individually and as a team member.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate a logical, safe and systematic approach to work practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out operational tests on low technology plant, equipment and machinery.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate using a range of methods.
