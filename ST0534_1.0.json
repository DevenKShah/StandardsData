  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation Profile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural Assistants work with Architects and other professionals such as Engineers, to competently design buildings and deliver architectural projects across scheme phases, from the initial client briefing process where objectives are agreed and feasibility studies conducted, through conceptual and technical proposals, to construction. In collaboration with other members of a project team, they respond to client requirements by preparing, reviewing and refining building design through the use of various media such as 3D modelling, drawings and model making.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural Assistants work under supervision of an Architect, Senior Architect or project leader, who has the overall responsibility for delivering a project. They contribute to delivering projects of varying scale and type; for example, an office skyscraper, semi-detached house, caf&#233;, school or bridge. Architectural Assistants work on the design of new buildings and the redesign of existing buildings (such as a house extension or an internal refurbishment).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work closely with a design team assembled to deliver the project. Design teams could include: Engineers, Quantity Surveyors, Interior Designers, Landscape Architects and Project Managers. They also work with other related professionals such as Town Planning Authorities, Heritage Consultants, Building Control Inspectors and/or Party Wall Surveyors; as well as skilled trades such as Carpenters or Joiners during the construction process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural Assistants work in organisations of varying sizes, from a small practice of only a few members to a large multi-disciplinary organisation. They can be based at office locations within project design teams, at on-site locations, or a combination of both. Because their skills are easily transferable they are able to work for other construction and design related businesses (e.g. property consultants, construction companies, planning authorities or interior designers).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architectural Assistants can progress to being an Architect. In order to become an architect in the UK, individuals must hold ARB (Architectural Registration Board) prescribed qualifications at Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 levels and register with the ARB.&#160; Only ARB-prescribed qualifications meet the standards that lead to registration as an architect in the UK.&#160; Only those who are appropriately qualified and registered with ARB can use the title ‘Architect’ in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;An Architectural Assistant’s work involves:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Reviewing project briefs to establish client’s requirements; site analysis (e.g. survey of an existing building for a refurbishment project); basic research of city planning context (e.g. establishing whether there are other similar buildings in the area); basic research of building regulations, including fire strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt;: Creating architectural designs that satisfy aesthetic, technical and functional requirements. This involves sketching concept ideas; team brainstorming; creating and editing drawings and 3D models using relevant CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software; creating physical models.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project delivery&lt;/strong&gt;: Producing information for formal submissions, under the supervision of an Architect or project leader, including sets of drawings (plans, sections and elevations), 3D models (e.g. BIM – Building Information Modelling), schedules (e.g. of doors or of windows), visuals (including hand drawn or computer generated), reports and presentation boards and physical models. It also involves communicating and coordinating design information with internal and external teams (including Engineers, Interior Designers).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction&lt;/strong&gt;: Attending construction sites and supporting the Architect or project leader in site inspections (e.g. capturing images of identified defects on-site) and answering routine queries on construction related issues and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following knowledge, skills, and behaviours reflect the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) shared Criteria for the Prescription of Qualifications at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ARB_Criteria_pt1.pdf&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A range of design processes and techniques such as hand-sketched drawings and diagrams; use of appropriate tools and materials to create physical building models of varying scale and complexity to explore and develop design ideas and for use in client presentations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generate architectural design proposals of diverse scales and type, including conducting feasibility studies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Draft and edit drawings and 3D models (plans, sections, elevations, and details) using relevant software, including CAD, to enable co-ordination with other professional’s input&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Produce and coordinate design information with the design team (e.g. engineering, landscaping and interior design)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

Fine Arts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Arts that relate to theoretical concepts of architecture (e.g. the use of colour and sound in creating atmosphere in spaces)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creatively apply theories, practices and technologies of the arts that influence architectural design&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.
