Typically, candidates will have achieved grade 4 (previously grade C) or above in at least five GCSE’s including English, Maths and a Science subject.&amp;nbsp; Employers will set their own entry requirements but typically candidates will hold a minimum of 96 UCAS points or existing relevant Level 3 qualifications. Other relevant or prior experience may also be considered as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard represents a logical progression for candidates who have completed lower level apprenticeships in the engineering and manufacturing route. For example: Engineering fitter (L3), Engineering technician (L3), Engineering manufacturing technician (L4), Space engineering technician (L4), Maintenance operations engineering technician (L3).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;T Level and A Level qualifications in science and engineering subject areas, and level 3 qualifications (such as BTEC, City &amp;amp; Guilds or Cambridge Technicals), in science and engineering also offer routes into this apprenticeship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the space sector, and primarily the &#39;upstream&#39; manufacturing area. This covers the design and production of spacecraft and the components and subsystems they comprise. It also includes production, operation and maintenance of highly specialised ground support equipment. Ground support equipment is used to support the development and testing of satellites and other equipment flown in space, before launch. Space systems engineers cover a broad range of mechanical, electronic, and thermal engineering disciplines. They usually specialise in one or more specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The upstream element of the industry is part of the overall space sector. It is related to but distinct from the &#39;downstream&#39; part of the sector. The downstream sector is concerned with the exploitation of data from satellites for end-user applications including weather forecasting and telecommunications. Although businesses in the downstream sector work mainly with data and services, many also employ space systems engineers. Income for the whole UK space sector has grown significantly. The upstream segment has been the majority contributor to the overall growth of the sector. Space is a key part of the UK’s Industrial Strategy supporting the development and increases in productivity of other key sectors. For example, Agribusiness, Transport and Health, through improved data provision and communications. Government has committed funding to new developments supporting the upstream sector. Investments include establishing UK space ports, funding of spacecraft technology programmes and a satellite launch capability, and the National Satellite Test Facility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Space Systems Engineers work in a variety of businesses. These can be small, medium or large enterprises. For example, specialising in, or involved with, space systems and space technology. They can also work in large national or global aerospace companies and space agencies. They are also found in academic institutions. Institutions include universities, government-funded science and technology research and development laboratories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to take a leading role in the design, manufacturing and testing of complex, high value space hardware and ground support equipment at component and sub-system level, using advanced integration skills. Space Systems Engineers receive customer and mission requirements. They use engineering and scientific principles and knowledge of the space environment to identify solutions to requirements. They also assist in research and development, provide technical expertise, support, solutions and leadership.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Space Systems Engineers typically work to normal business hours. They can be required to work shifts and weekends in particular circumstances. For example, during launch support, or in periods leading up to major project delivery milestones. They typically work in secure and controlled environments, workshops and development areas. These can involve working at ground level, and at high level on gantries and walkways. They also work in regular offices. Some of these environments can be highly specialised (for example, rocket propulsion test facilities). These environments can involve working with very high pressure gas and fluid delivery systems, high vacuum facilities, and cryogenic fluids and delivery systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of stakeholders. Within their organisation they interact with the project manager, engineering team members, technical specialists, systems engineers, senior managers. They also interact with other internal teams such as finance, health and safety, and marketing. They may also interact directly with external stakeholders such as the customer or client, as well as suppliers and service providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake within the limits of their personal authority. Space systems engineers adhere to statutory regulations and organisational health and safety requirements. They also identify, and carry out work in compliance with, standards imposed by key customers. For example, space agencies and regulatory bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) or the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS).&lt;/p&gt;",
