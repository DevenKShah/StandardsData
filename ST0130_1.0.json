The dispensation will last from 25th March 2025 to 25th September 2025 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.\nEnd-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider.&nbsp;\nThe key changes are:&nbsp;\n1.2 Assessment arrangements when national security is a factor&nbsp;\nThe Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) may approve a variation to EPA delivery where it confirms, having considered adequate evidence, it is satisfied that:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n• all options supporting a fully independent model have been exhausted and&nbsp;&nbsp;\n• national security issues prevent remote end-point assessment and&nbsp;\n• the fair assessment of occupational competence can only be achieved in the apprentice’s operating environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIt is expected this approach to delivery is only applicable to the Royal Navy because of their unique operating environment combined with their role in connection with national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIfATE must be satisfied that every possible way of having a fully independent EPA has been considered and that the unique circumstances of the Royal Navy prevents any arrangements for a fully independent model.&nbsp;\nIfATE must also be satisfied that the EPA meets all of its other requirements, including the delivery of valid and accurate judgements of occupational competence, such that all apprentices who complete the EPA will be judged competent in the occupation regardless of who their employer is.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&nbsp;Bespoke EPA arrangements for this apprenticeship have been approved by IfATE for the Royal Navy to use. Further details can be found on the apprenticeships web-page on the IfATE website.\n\nThe final apprenticeship EPA decision will be made by the EPAO; successful achievement of the EPA will lead to formal certification of the apprenticeship and demonstrate that the apprentice is a competent Unified Communications Trouble Shooter.",
