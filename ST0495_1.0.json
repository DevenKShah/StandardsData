  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A Rail and Rail Systems Engineer works as part of a multi-disciplinary team, but with personal responsibility and accountability for projects related to their specialist area. They can work in multiple railway worksites or in technical offices. They have a strong understanding of how the railway works as a whole and are able to assess the impact of their work and its interfaces with other teams. This includes an understanding of &#160;conventional rail or high speed rail, or both. They are responsible for the provision of rail specific technical engineering knowledge relating to a specific aspect of the railway. Specialist areas include rail specific civil engineering, rail track, rail signalling and control, rail systems &amp;amp; integration, rail traction and rolling stock, rail telecommunications, network and digital and rail electrical, mechanical and building services. The overarching role of all Rail &amp;amp; Rail Systems Engineers is to ensure the railway runs smoothly on a day to day basis and to provide rail specific engineering knowledge across their own organisation to ensure this is the case.
