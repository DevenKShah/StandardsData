  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in engineering and manufacturing in the following sectors: energy (renewables, nuclear), infrastructure, petro-chemical, aerospace, pharmaceutical, highways, rail, utilities and defence. There is a growing demand for project controls professionals across the public and private sector to work on complex projects from the very start to the end such as HS2, Hinkley Point C, Dreadnought and Thames Tideway. The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure that multi-faceted engineering and infrastructure projects deliver successfully and safely to time, cost and quality: by critically analysing, interpreting and evaluating technical information to develop coding structures, cost and time objectives, robust recommendations and recovery plans for the project, programme or portfolio manager.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A project controls professional is needed where the level of risk associated with the project such as commercial; safety; environmental; legal; and/or people, is sufficiently great to require independent assurance and verification of technical information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technical information includes: cost information, estimates, schedules and plans, risk, change, scoping documents, statistics, probabilities, engineering drawings and plans etc.. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with people across the business including the project, programme or portfolio manager, senior specialists, decision-makers and other colleagues. In addition, they have regular contact with engineers, site managers, clients and the supply chain. On a day to day basis the project controls professional works closely with team members and support staff. The project controls professional (PCP) will be either office or site based depending on the demands of the project. Travel and flexible working may be necessary to support the project.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the organisation, they may be the only PCP on the project, part of the team or they may lead a team of project control technicians (PCTs) that deliver information and/ or report to them. They may be responsible for developing others within the organisation. Depending on the organisation they would typically report into the Director of project controls. PCPs will typically work under matrix management arrangements.. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for providing strategic, authoritative advice and recommendations to the senior decision-making panel in order to keep the project on track. The PCP is essential to complex projects in providing appropriate recommendations to influence the decision-making process.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are accountable for assuring the validity and reliability of the project controls information on the project and for interpreting the project controls reports being fed into them from the project controls technicians. They are accountable for providing an essential insight into the health of the project, programme, and portfolio and for making recommendations to control the project.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PCP has a comprehensive understanding of the component parts of the project across the life cycle. They understand the context of the analysis of the data and the impact of decisions. They have the confidence to challenge and interpret data reports, to interrogate and question the assumptions, the risks etc. They have an in-depth understanding of the technical data and what it means in detail because they have both technical knowledge and the skill to apply this in the context of controlling the project. This is why they are essential on complex projects and why project controls professionals are needed to work alongside project/programme and portfolio managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PCP is critical in terms of ensuring the project controls processes capture the right, meaningful, quality data from within the company and/or subcontractors in the right format at the right time and is analysed and interpreted in the correct context â€“ this is essential to ensure effective control.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PCP is autonomous and self-directing. They decide where their expertise is needed in a project to which they have been assigned.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically, the PCP works on a range of projects which may include projects with multi-million pound budgets, spanning over several years, across multi-locations, with inter-disciplinary teams. The project manager (PM) has ultimate responsibility for decisions made on a project. The PCP is accountable for the recommendations that they make to the project, programme and portfolio manager. The PCP influences at PM and above PM level to a project controls director. Project control has to be independent of project management in order to ensure effective control.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Project Controls Technician is responsible predominantly for gathering, entering, processing and analysing data which they then present upwards to the PCP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on organisational need, Project Controls Technicians may report to the PCP, particularly on large, complex projects. Alternatively, the Project Controls Technicians may be working on smaller projects and report to project managers directly. In those instances, a PCP would be required to provide the assurance for project control across the portfolio of projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The PCP has significant specialised knowledge and skills regarding the validity, integrity, integration, assurance, accountability of the data and the advice that they provide to the PM in order to influence the decision-making process. The PCP leads across the subordinate project controls disciplines (estimators, planners, schedulers, cost controllers)&lt;/p&gt;",
