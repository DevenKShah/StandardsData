  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation Profile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architects are registered professionals, trained to requirements defined by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Only those who are appropriately qualified and registered with ARB can use the title ‘Architect’ in the UK.&#160; The ARB sets the UK standards for entry on to the Register of Architects and prescribes qualifications that lead to registration as an architect. These standards must be met in order to register as an architect. Architects lead on the processes of planning, designing and reviewing the construction of buildings; and are usually the first point of contact on a design team, working with the client and contractor to make final decisions during the design and construction process. Architects use their skills and knowledge to offer creative problem solving and strategic advice related to various types of building, arts and construction projects. This includes developing building designs taking into account multiple constraints, such as structural integrity, the character and location of a site, methods of construction, value for money, design quality and impact on the environment, as well as legal responsibilities. Architects work responsibly to deliver the interests of their clients and the core requirements of cost, time and quality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architects work on projects of varying scale and type across the construction industry, including but not limited to the design of commercial, residential, community, education and infrastructure buildings and structures. Architects work on the design of new buildings and the redesign of existing buildings. They work closely with design and construction related professionals and often lead a design team or teams assembled to design and/or deliver the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Architects can work as sole practitioners, in small practices or within large multi-disciplinary organisations. Within larger organisations they may report to a Senior Architect or project leader and can be based at office locations within project design teams, at on-site locations or a combination of both. Because their skills are easily transferable they are able to work for other construction and design related businesses (e.g. property consultants or interior designers).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An Architect’s work includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brief analysis and project set-up: &lt;/strong&gt;Leading on brief analysis, researching city planning, negotiating Architect’s appointments, setting sustainability goals, advising clients on procurement routes and potentially assembling the design team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design: &lt;/strong&gt;Generating design proposals in a variety of contexts and applying knowledge of architectural issues to satisfy aesthetic, technical and functional requirements. This involves an in-depth understanding of design theory to create and find innovative solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project delivery: &lt;/strong&gt;Leading projects or parts of projects, identifying risks and delivering services in a manner which prioritises the interest of the client and within the framework of relevant legal standards. This includes the production of submissions and coordination of design tasks and teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construction and building procurement:&lt;/strong&gt; Inspecting building construction on site and commenting on contractors and sub-contractors’ work against architectural drawings, and offering impartial advice on construction related procurement methods and contractor selection processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership and practice management: &lt;/strong&gt;Business administration, including developing or contributing to the strategic vision of a practice. Overseeing the work of junior staff including Architectural Assistants.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following knowledge, skills and behaviours relate to the ARB and RIBA shared Criteria for the Prescription of Qualifications at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ARB_Criteria_pt2.pdf&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arb.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ARB_Criteria_pt3.pdf&quot;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;width: 687px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 116px;&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 259.188px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 250.812px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 116px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Architects are registered professionals, trained to requirements defined by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). Only those who are appropriately qualified and registered with ARB can use the title ‘Architect’ in the UK. The ARB sets the UK standards for entry on to the Register of Architects and prescribes qualifications that lead to registration as an architect. These standards must be met in order to register as an architect. Architects lead on the processes of planning, designing and reviewing the construction of buildings; and are usually the first point of contact on a design team, working with the client and contractor to make final decisions during the design and construction process. Architects use their skills and knowledge to offer creative problem solving and strategic advice related to various types of building, arts and construction projects. This includes developing building designs taking into account multiple constraints, such as structural integrity, the character and location of a site, methods of construction, value for money, design quality and impact on the environment, as well as legal responsibilities. Architects work responsibly to deliver the interests of their clients and the core requirements of cost, time and quality. Architects work on projects of varying scale and type across the construction industry, including but not limited to the design of commercial, residential, community, education and infrastructure buildings and structures. Architects work on the design of new buildings and the redesign of existing buildings. They work closely with design and construction related professionals and often lead a design team or teams assembled to design and/or deliver the project. Architects can work as sole practitioners, in small practices or within large multi-disciplinary organisations. Within larger organisations they may report to a Senior Architect or project leader and can be based at office locations within project design teams, at on-site locations or a combination of both. Because their skills are easily transferable they are able to work for other construction and design related businesses (e.g. property consultants or interior designers).&lt;/p&gt;",
