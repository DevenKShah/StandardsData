They will report to a cleaning supervisor or service leader. They will work both during normal working hours and outside of normal working hours, depending on the environment they are in. They may also need to provide services immediately throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare cleaning and hygiene operatives work in places where infection control and sanitation are important for the wellbeing of service users. High levels of cleanliness are needed to avoid the growth of bacteria and the spread of diseases and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Places a healthcare cleaning operative may work in include hospitals, care homes, doctors or dentist surgeries, and healthcare settings within prisons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Commercial cleaning and hygiene operatives work in environments where people mix and that must be thoroughly cleaned to ensure they are always safe and hygienic.

They use their knowledge of standard operating procedures (SOPs)and legal requirements to provide safe and hygienic environments for service users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare cleaning operatives must carry out their duties in line within the National Healthcare Cleaning Standards which applies to all NHS facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Commercial cleaning operatives must carry out their duties in line within the regulations, processes, and procedures specific to the environment they clean. Operatives will always be required to work within the limits of the client contract.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who the employee will interact with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare cleaning operatives may interact with service users such as patients and residents with specific needs, contractors, and visitors to the premises. They will also interact with clinical or care staff as they are often part of a multi-disciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Commercial cleaning operatives may interact with service users such as students, domestic home residents, office or factory workers, guests and visitors to the premises. They will also interact with clients, employees, and contractors as they may be part of a multi-disciplinary facilities team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for following strict health and safety requirements and meeting a high level of cleanliness.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All operatives will be responsible for maintaining the tools and equipment they are given to carry out their role, reporting any defects or replacements that are needed to the right person.&lt;/p&gt;",
