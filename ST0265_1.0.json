  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the construction sector. &#160;On site assembly of manufactured components is a rapidly growing part of the construction sector, representing 15% of the market in 2018. &#160;Projects include; infrastructure, residential, commercial, retail, healthcare, education, rail, prisons and leisure. &#160;Structures and components are manufactured in factories and then transported to the construction site, ready for location, connection and finishing. &#160;Materials can include concrete, timber, modular and portable buildings and can include plastic and steel components. &#160;Projects can be small local ones such as a bespoke house or nationwide in large scale developments such as residential and social housing, schools and hospitals. &#160;These can be permanent, temporary or re-locatable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of this occupation is to use elements manufactured off site, installed and assembled in a construction site environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with team colleagues and supervisors as well as those from other organisations such as main contractors, sub-contractors, architects, engineers, plant operators, drivers, Health and Safety Executive representatives, Environment Agency, site managers, construction managers and other trades. &#160;The occupation involves working outside on a construction site, in a range of weather conditions, on projects anywhere in the UK. &#160;In some instances it will involve travelling and working away from home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the assembly and installation of manufactured components to agreed design specification and tolerance. &#160;This includes the safe handling, moving, installing and finishing to specification and within deadlines under the guidance of senior team colleagues or a supervisor depending on the size of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship consists of four optional routes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-cast Concrete&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Timber Frame&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relocatable Modular and Portable Buildings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Permanent Modular Buildings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
