Rail Infrastructure Operators will be required to work closely with stakeholders e.g. controllers, train drivers, maintenance staff, power companies and specialists e.g. emergency services in order to respond effectively to incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rail Infrastructure Operators may be required to work in a small control location, a major operations control room or be required to go trackside depending on their discipline and the activity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship adopts a core and options approach to allow flexibility for employers and enable transferability between roles and employers for apprentices. The core content includes safety, quality and customer service, the apprentice will then follow one of the following specialist options: Signalling Operator, Electrical Controller or Incident Responder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signalling Operators &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for the movement of rail transport through the safe operation of signalling control systems. Signalling Operators regulate the safe movement and control of rail transport and communicate to rail transport drivers, those working on rail infrastructure as well as members of the public, to enable them to move or work safely across the network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical Controllers &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for maintaining and controlling the electrical supply to the rail network to ensure the smooth operation of passenger services, safe access to the rail network for maintenance and incident response. Electrical supply is required for signalling, traction and other assets, such as tunnel ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident Responders &lt;/strong&gt;are responsible for making the rail infrastructure safe and minimising service disruptions following an incident or event, this can range from low-level situations (e.g. level crossing failure and animals on the line) through to supporting major events (e.g. derailment, fatalities and fire).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the nature and scale, an Incident Responder will either take direct action or assist in activities with specialists in order to return back to safe operations and minimise service disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During non-response time Incident Responders will assist colleagues with monitoring the network to identify potential issues and/or incident avoidance activities e.g. weather preparedness, checking of fences and gates or inspecting operational locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ENTRY AND QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the entry criteria for their own apprentices.

Incident Responders will seek input and advice from both electrical controllers and signalling operators and take the necessary decisions to ensure safe access to the incident site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be able to take control of an incident, identify the correct type of response and implement a prioritised plan e.g. applying and removing a temporary and emergency speed restriction, removal of objects from overhead line. This may be either as an initial responder to a major event or taking control of a local railway specific event such as animals on the line, level crossing failures and trespassers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure the correct protection measures have been taken to make an incident safe for those directly impacted e.g. colleagues, passengers, emergency services.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Facilitate investigation and recovery activities such as preserving evidence; initiating an investigation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Follow a defined set of procedures which outline the basic response to an incident, such as arrive on site, assess, make safe, report and liaise with others as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the rail sector across different types of organisations that together deliver the United Kingdom’s integrated rail system. This includes employers operating mainline and local rail networks, underground networks, and high-speed rail lines. Depending on type of network, rail infrastructure operators can expect to typically be based either in a small control location or a major operations control room. They may at times be required to go trackside. Rail infrastructure operators usually work shift patterns, helping to keep the rail network safe 24 hours a day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure trains travel on the network safely and efficiently to plan. They do this in a number of ways. They use signalling and train control systems to manage the rail transport network in line with an agreed train plan/timetable. This means making tactical decisions about how to best implement the plan so the network runs smoothly. They also respond to incidents, where the operational integrity of the rail transport network is affected. Particular features of this occupation are being fully aware of everything that might impact rail operations, plus the ability to maintain high levels of concentration and decide complex issues very quickly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with many other stakeholders who contribute to making rail journeys happen on the network. Depending on the type of line, they typically interact with train drivers, maintenance staff, power suppliers, infrastructure controllers and specialists e.g., emergency services to respond effectively to incidents. They also communicate with other operators in different sectors of the rail industry, such as station staff or train crew. They liaise in order to safely deliver the agreed rail timetable, as well as manage variations caused by short notice changes to demand and circumstances e.g., disruption caused by extreme weather. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for operating the signalling and train control systems that provide access to the rail network for all train service groups running in the specific geographical area. Rail infrastructure operators are responsible for monitoring the progress of all the live rail movements within their area against predetermined train plans/timetables. Rail Infrastructure operators don’t design timetables, but they have the powers to adjust planned services where this will help efficiency or avoid disruption, communicating changes to those affected. They balance the needs of passenger and freight operators within the constraints of the rules, local railway infrastructure, signalling system and rolling stock. Safety is the priority and all decisions taken by the rail infrastructure operator must be complaint with rail regulations. Throughout their shift, a rail infrastructure operator must keep a careful log of all notable events. And they are typically expected to provide reports on network performance, as required by their own organisation. At the start and end of a shift, they provide and receive handovers to colleagues, that ensures continuity of service. They are responsible for proactively identifying incidents and disruptions. When this happens, they are responsible for making the rail infrastructure safe and minimising service disruptions. Such events can range from low-level situations (e.g., level crossing failure and animals on the line) through to supporting major incidents (e.g., derailment, fatalities and fire). Depending on the nature and scale, they will either take direct action or work alongside specialists by communicating what’s needed and sharing information, to return to safe operations and minimise service disruptions. During normal working rail infrastructure operators work within defined areas of responsibility with complete autonomy for the area they control in terms of safety and performance. Decisions are sometimes escalated to a line manager or technical expert in times of disruption when the needs of the whole network need to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;",
