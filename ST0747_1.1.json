  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The Counter Fraud Investigator (CFI) operates within the law enforcement sector and would typically be employed by HMRC, DEFRA, Department of Health, Insolvency Service, DWP, SFO and Local Government. The CFI acts autonomously leading small non-complex criminal investigations and a range of civil investigations. They can also act as case officer within a large investigation team, as required, carrying out parts of a more complex investigation as directed by the Lead Investigator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadly, it is the CFI&#39;s responsibility to proactively investigate allegations of fraud and make effective, autonomous operational decisions from referral to conclusion to drive their investigations. Conclusion could mean support of a successful prosecution, levy of penalty (or equivalent) or no further action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI fully understands the range of interventions available to them when investigating fraud in relation to assigned matters, policies and legislation, then decides on the most appropriate method to proceed. To do this the CFI uses knowledge of civil procedures such as applications to tribunal, giving evidence at tribunal and Judicial Review, knowledge of associated civil penalties and other enforcement measures such as insolvency action. The CFI understands when it is more appropriate to conduct or switch to a criminal investigation how to do this and how to work safely within the Criminal Justice System. The CFI has knowledge and understanding of PACE, RIPA, CPIA, HRA, PoCA and/or other legislation to apply for Warrants and Orders. The CFI interacts with Lawyers, Judges, Magistrates, other professionals and other law enforcement partners, to achieve these and other work objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI plans and conducts different types of evidence gathering activity and takes/maintains notes appropriate to that activity. This involves interaction with members of the public from all backgrounds and conducting tasks such as a formal meeting with a company director or professional advisor, interview under caution, taking third party witness statements, making evidential notes of searches and observations during surveillance. The CFI operates for extended periods in any type of environment from an office or court room to a building site or multi occupancy residence, depending on the direction their enquiries lead them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidence gathering situations include searches of premises, review of business accounts and their constituent parts and other professional documents. The CFI understands and is able to search digital databases and other online platforms. They recognise Legally Privileged Material and other protected information as described in law and treat it appropriately. They quickly identify evidence in fast paced sometimes confrontational situations amongst what will mainly be irrelevant material. They understand the different types of surveillance available, when it is necessary and proportionate to use surveillance and the duty of care to the citizen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CFI role may involve confrontational situations, including arrest, and the CFI properly risk assesses any activity undertaken by creating plans to mitigate or reduce the identified risks where possible. They write professional briefings to ensure that all colleagues engaged in any planned investigation activity are aware of their roles and responsibilities and the risks identified. They take on a leadership role in the work they are conducting and are accountable for their actions and decisions, able to explain these to senior leaders, prosecutors and officers of the court as a witness.&lt;/p&gt;",
