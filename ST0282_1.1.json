Measurement underpins the UK economy and international trade. Each year in the UK over&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#163;600 billion worth of goods and utilities are sold based on the measurement of their quantity and quality. Metrology takes place across a wide range of industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, construction, energy, environment, pharma and healthcare and space and within all sizes of organisation. Important measurement activities can range from measuring galaxies to graphene, molecules, chemical pollutants, hip joints, aircraft, industrial emissions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This important work is carried out by skilled Metrology Technicians who understand core measurement principles and practices and whose role is to interpret and apply these whilst carrying out measurement activities in whichever industry they work. They are also able to identify measurement needs and plan and perform measurement tasks using tools, equipment, instrumentation and software programs. Metrology is vital to improve the quality and throughput of goods and utilities, which in turn is essential to increasing productivity and customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology Technicians must comply with statutory regulations and health and safety requirements. They will be able to carry out work with minimal supervision, take responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake, and will have a high level of attention to detail. The successful apprentice will become a valuable measurement specialist, within their organisation, significantly contributing to the future of the Metrology industry and the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job toles may include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Technicians associated with Measurement research;
