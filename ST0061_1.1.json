Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building Services Engineering makes buildings work. Service and Maintenance Engineers play a key role in planning and completing a range of maintenance work encompassing industrial and commercial building services engineering systems such as ventilating, heating, water supply, waste (effluent discharge) and drainage. This includes related electrical isolation, disconnection, reconnection and reactivation. They also complete planned preventative maintenance and undertake any required remedial repairs. In addition, they monitor and manage the operation of plant and equipment through building and energy management systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They ensure these systems continue to operate to their design specification. They undertake work with a high level of autonomy and require highly developed diagnostic skills, detailed knowledge of system operating principles and the ability to take responsibility for fault finding, fault diagnosis, repair and maintenance of systems, components and equipment found in industrial and commercial buildings like office blocks, shopping centres, hotels, factories, schools and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dealing with clients is an important aspect of Service and Maintenance Engineers work, to ensure maintenance activities are undertaken with minimum down time and impact on the buildings use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are able to demonstrate competence in the health and safety, communication, quality control and environmental requirements appropriate to their scope of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Service and Maintenance Engineers are able to work within occupied and unoccupied buildings and facilities on their own, proficiently and without supervision, in the most appropriate, efficient and economical manner.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in industrial and commercial buildings, for example office blocks, factories, schools, and hospitals. Building Services Engineering makes buildings work. It is a specialist branch of engineering within the construction sector. Service and maintenance engineers play a key role in planning and completing a range of maintenance work. They also monitor and manage the operation of plant and equipment through building and energy management systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to plan and compete a variety of maintenance activities involving industrial and commercial building services engineering systems. They carry out scheduled preventative maintenance as well as any required remedial or corrective repairs. These engineers use building and energy management systems to monitor and manage the operation of plant and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with clients, suppliers, site managers and other trades on site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for health and safety appropriate to their scope of work. They make sure systems keep working according to the specifications they were designed with. Service and maintenance engineers will fault find, fault diagnose, repair, and maintain systems, components, and equipment. They work within occupied and unoccupied buildings and facilities on their own, proficiently and without supervision. They must communicate with team members and site managers. In addition to taking environmental regulations into account, they will assume ownership of the quality of their job.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A building services and maintenance engineers must stay updated on the latest industry standards and regulations to ensure compliance and keep the systems in line with current guidelines. Overall, their expertise and attention to detail contribute to the smooth operation and longevity of the systems they maintain. Maintenance engineers also play a crucial role in the overall efficiency and performance of the systems they oversee.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;Service and maintenance engineers are also responsible for conducting regular inspections and preventive maintenance to identify potential issues before they become major problems. Additionally, they may be required to keep detailed records of their work, including any repairs or replacements made, to ensure accurate documentation and compliance with regulations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
