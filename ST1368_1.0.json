  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations from small law firms to large corporate entities and public bodies, anywhere that offers or requires litigation and advocacy services. A Chartered Legal Executive Litigator and Advocate (CLELA)) works in areas of law that require presenting in court on family, civil or criminal matters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to handle legal matters including giving legal advice and present in the courts. Presenting in court is a reserved or regulated area of legal practice. As the CLELA has specialised in a reserved or regulated area of practice, they will hold the appropriate rights to practise in that area independently, including advising and representing their clients in the County Court, Family Proceedings Court, Magistrates&#39; Court including the Youth Court, Coroners Court and in most Tribunals. The CLELA drafts legal documents, including case theory, skeleton arguments and submissions to the courts. They may also act as a Commissioner for Oaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending upon which area of law they work in, CLELA lawyers may be involved in litigation in the High Court, litigation and advocacy in the County Courts, advising and representing husbands and wives with matrimonial problems or clients accused of serious or petty crime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CLELA lawyers are fee earners and are able to set up their own legal practice once qualified. In private practice, their work is charged directly to clients making a direct contribution to the income of a law firm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate legal team, legally and non-legally trained stakeholders and customers who use their services. They may also interact with government departments, financial institutions, regulators and professional bodies. They will regularly attend relevant Courts and Tribunals to represent their clients and need to gain two years’ experience in the courts for which they are seeking rights of audience prior to completion of the apprenticeship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for managing a caseload of legal matters, providing advice to customers and advocating for clients in courtroom settings. The CLELA works unsupervised within their area of specialism.&lt;/p&gt;",
