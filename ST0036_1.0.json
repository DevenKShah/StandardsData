  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;This standard has now been withdrawn at the request of the trailblazer group, as they decided it no longer met the needs of the sector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Airside operators are the ‘eyes and ears’ of the airfield team, and spend much of their working day or night out on the airfield patrolling, inspecting and then addressing situations to ensure that the flow of arriving and departing aircraft are on schedule. Although every airport is slightly different, the role covers a multitude of tasks including area inspections; patrolling the perimeter fence around the airport; monitoring bird activity and clearing wildlife using specialist vehicles and equipment; monitoring aircraft turnarounds and marshalling. The airside operator works in a high risk, safety critical environment requiring excellent communication, prioritising, effective decision making, problem solving and technical skills. The role requires a keen sense of situational awareness and the need to work safely to minimise incidents and accidents.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table

same&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armed Forces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the armed forces the requirements of the role differ due to allocation of roles and responsibilities according to rank and designation, for example, the Royal Air Force role of a Flight&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Operations Assistant is similar but differs in the following ways: A Flight Operations Assistant will be employed in one of two locations; an Operations Room or an Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower. Within an ATC tower they will be employed as an Approach, Local, movements Logger, Radar assistant or Switchboard Assistant and as a Driver if able. An Operations Room Assistant will not generally spend time on the airfield. Non-drivers can also be employed in either location. Employers and representatives from both the RAF and commercial airports have come together to identify the main knowledge; skills and behaviour that they agree are essential for airside operators to achieve a professional standard. However due to limitations within the armed forces those marked with * will be assessed as either progression or transfer into airside operations in a commercial airport.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;12 Months. The apprenticeship may be spread over a longer period to allow for seasonal business operations&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Progresssion&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individuals that successfully achieve the airside operators’ apprenticeship standard will be well placed to progress to a supervisory position / apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard is set at level 2&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Renewal&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;July 2017, except in the exception of a significant industry change for which the rationale is agreed to be sufficiently robust by employers responsible for overseeing the standard to warrant an earlier amendment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Recognition&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship standard for airside operators is supported by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).&lt;/p&gt;",
