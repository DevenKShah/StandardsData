  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the construction, plant and tool hire industry as well as allied industries such as rail plant, demolition and quarrying that use construction-based equipment. The broad purpose of the occupation is to service, maintain and repair the wide range of construction-based equipment used within the construction and allied industries such as mobile cranes, excavators, disc cutters, crushers, demolition plant, road-rail equipment, water pumps, telescopic handlers etc. so that they function correctly, safely and efficiently, allowing construction and other projects to be carried out efficiently and on time. This occupation provides a vital support service that is crucial to the prosperity of the country through completion of vital infrastructure projects such a (nuclear) power generation, roads, rail, airports etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The construction equipment mechanic checks, services and undertakes basic fault finding activities and will either through their own fault-finding activities or through given instructions, remove, dismantle, repair, assemble and refit a plethora of components, and ensure that the item of plant is fully functional prior to handover to the operational side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Construction equipment mechanics work not just within construction but also work in other areas including quarrying, demolition, utilities (water/gas/electric etc.), piling, rail, waste/landfill, housing, highways etc... In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with customers, members of the public, supervisors, co-workers, other trades/occupations, supporting occupations, managers, suppliers, safety professionals, manufacturers, administration staff. The mechanic can be mobile, working on-site on a national basis and/or workshop-based undertaking maintenance activities in all weathers. This may include working on their own although subject to overall guidance and direction by others. The work can include weekend and night work to cover breakdowns on roadworks, rail maintenance projects etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Construction related environments including site-based, mobile, workshop based in and outdoors in all seasons.. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring they have the right tools and resources such as oils, lubricants and parts for each task. They analyse problems or defects, identify any repair issues and undertake maintenance tasks whilst applying the correct manufacturer’s technical information required and in conformance with legislative requirements. They work under generic supervision either within a workshop or on site but are expected to be both autonomous and the technical focal point during any maintenance activity.&lt;/p&gt;",
