  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a broad range of creative and dynamic industries for example theatre, TV, film, fashion, commercials and print media (editorial). The broad purpose of the occupation is to uphold the highest standards of hygiene and technical application to achieve the required look meeting agreed standards for productions/performances across a range of artists, periods and cultures whilst maintaining health &amp;amp; safety requirements. This may involve the safe application and styling of wigs, hair, make-up and prosthetic special effects to performers. Make–up and hair are key elements in the overall design of live performance, films or television productions, creating a look for the characters in relation to social class, time periods, and any other elements required to create the desired effect or illusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will involve using a variety of techniques such as:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;hair work including; cutting, colouring, setting, dressing and preparing hair for wig wearing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;wig, facial hair and postiche work including: fitting, head wraps, head block preparation, making foundation, whipping, knotting, weaving, sewing postiche together with cutting, colouring, perming, setting and dressing of wigs, postiche and hair pieces.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;make-up work including: researching and applying media make-up, character make-up and special effects using a variety of techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;prosthetics work including; material research, life casting, mould making, the use of foam latexes and silicones, surface rendering and application to make and apply bald caps, body parts, wounds and blemishes. This will also include the application of stage bloods for injuries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hair, Wigs, Make-up and Prosthetics Technicians work with Designers and Directors to discuss the look required for each role for example, artists/performers may need to appear from a different age group or historical period; the hair, make-up and wigs may be contemporary and straightforward or require more creative approaches. They prepare and use design notes, reference sheets and photographs that will ensure the artist/performer will have the same hair or make-up every time. They support preparatory stages, rehearsals and actual performances/production and work closely with artists/performers to get them ready and undertake quick changes throughout the performance/production. For prosthetics, which are part of the physical special effects area, they will need to use reliable sources to research prosthetic effects that are authentic and appropriate, create prosthetics in line with production requirements, script/breakdown and budget, liaise and work in collaboration with relevant people to ensure that all prosthetic effects are safe at all times, monitor people using prosthetics at all times so as to ensure there are no allergic reactions, excessive changes in body temperature or effects on their ability to function with ease, and remove prosthetics in line with safety requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They work within budget and time constraints to achieve project requirements.. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other members of their team and their supervisors to meet the project objectives. They meet with designers to interpret the design requirements. They develop a good working relationship with performers/artists/clients. They work with other departments e.g. art, production, technical, costume to achieve the performance/production requirements. They may work alongside photographers, film crew and other people involved in the event.. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working within health, safety and environmental policies, procedures and regulations to meet design specification for wigs, hair and make-up including prosthetics for special effects. They are required to choose and use the appropriate application techniques and approach to achieve the required outcomes by transforming artists/performers into the required look from their natural state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They engage with artists/performers in a professional manner, demonstrating sensitivity in dealing with them when in their care and keep any personal information confidential and observing the set etiquette required. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hair, Wigs, Make-up and Prosthetics Technicians work with other team members to achieve the objectives of the project, including timescales and managing resources in their control which may include their tools and equipment, budget and stock. They are trusted to work unsupervised under the brief of their supervisor. They will be required to work during evenings and weekends during performance/production periods..&lt;/p&gt;",
