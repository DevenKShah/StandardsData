However, starts on the apprenticeship will only be possible once a suitable end-point assessment organisation (EPAO) has obtained Ofqual recognition. Once the EPAO has obtained Ofqual recognition, funding for apprentice starts will be permitted and this message will be removed.; Starts on this apprenticeship are paused in the absence of an End Point Assessment Organisation (EPAO). Starts will be permitted only once a suitable EPAO is in place. We do not want any current apprentices to be disadvantaged so we have applied a temporary dispensation to the\u00A0 V1.0 end-point assessment plan (EPA) version AP01 for this apprenticeship. The dispensation will last until 31st December 2025 and\u00A0may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner, or the dispensation is no longer necessary.\nIf your organisation is considering beginning the delivery of this standard and (or) EPA, you must contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk for further details before commencing with any development work as the current dispensation may impact upon feasibility.",
