  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile: &lt;/strong&gt;High speed rail is a specialist occupational area of work. High speed rail specialists include civil engineers, higher technicians in track, power and infrastructure, and operations managers. The High Speed Rail and Infrastructure Advanced Technician provides technical solutions across the construction, maintenance and operation of a high speed railway, as defined by their job role. They are responsible for the safe design, construction, installation, maintenance and operation of a high speed railway that provides a safe and reliable service for its customers. The Advanced Technician will need skills and knowledge relating to both high speed and conventional rail networks and infrastructure in order to manage the interface between the systems. High Speed Rail and Infrastructure Advanced Technicians will have core knowledge, skills and behaviours, and knowledge and skills in a specialist area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job roles include: &lt;/strong&gt;High Speed Rail and Infrastructure Advanced Technician in civil engineering; track; systems engineering; power; command, control and communication systems; operations and rolling stock.
