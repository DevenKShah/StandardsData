The broad purpose of the occupation is the leadership, management and coordination of the design and/or construction process on building and infrastructure projects, acting as the link between designers (i.e. architects, engineers) construction teams and project stakeholders.&amp;nbsp; The role can encompass overseeing internal and external design consultants, controlling the development of the design concept and translating this into the final building or installation. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the project team, such as bid management, estimating, pre-construction management, project planning and programming.&amp;nbsp; On-site, this role is more construction information focused, maintaining and co-ordinating the flow of design information to enable construction work to proceed efficiently, as well as facilitating cost control and the buildability review processes. An employee in this occupation will develop design proposals, which meet the requirements of the project brief, managing the design information and translating it to construction teams on site.&amp;nbsp; They will ensure that potential risks have been taken into account in all designs and that health and safety regulations have been adhered to and will help to ensure that the project is completed to the specification outlined in the design and to agreed parameters of cost and programme, which may sometime require adherence to statutory consents and legislation.&amp;nbsp; They will ensure the project has minimal impact on the environment and the local community and that sustainability objectives are realised, for the life cycle of the project, managing interfaces between the various stakeholders associated with the design and construction process.&amp;nbsp; Assisting in contract administration and compliance for the project, they will ultimately contribute to the management of project handover and completion to the customer/client, and be instrumental in recording feedback from stakeholders leading to the implementation of best practice in future projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include Architectural Technologist, Design Manager, Building Information Modelling (BIM) Manager and Construction Design Manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;KSBs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K1:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Design Procedures:&amp;nbsp; Know how to identify, assess and challenge client requirements and user factors, evaluate resources and assess environmental impact.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Health and Safety:&amp;nbsp; Know how to identify, control and mitigate hazards and risks and incorporate health and safety considerations into design at an early stage and ensure compliance with associated regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K3:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Regulations:&amp;nbsp; Know how to assess and advise on regulatory and legal requirements and constraints, including Construction Design and Management (CDM) Regulations and Building Regulations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K4:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Project Brief:&amp;nbsp; Know how to prepare, present and agree proposals for client briefs and develop design programmes to meet the requirements of the brief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K5:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Project Management:&amp;nbsp; Know how to select and form a design team and agree responsibilities and processes prior to construction and monitor design team’s working methods during construction, including the preparation of design and construction programmes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;K6:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; Teamwork:&amp;nbsp; Understand the importance of working in teams and how to lead others towards common goals.
