  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Construction, Infrastructure and the Built Environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to check, prepare and operate a number of construction machines (known as plant) that is used onsite in the construction sector including on railways, demolition and utility works (water/gas/electricity supply).&#160; This apprenticeship involves the learning on four common types of construction plant and includes a 360-degree excavator, dumper/dump truck, forklift and ride-on roller. The ability to operate a core range of plant onsite will enable apprentices to work across a number of projects and provide the basis of upgrading to more specialist plant such as graders, dozers, demolition plant etc. They can progress to becoming a lead operator, supervisor, site or plant manager, or even set up their own contracting company.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although each machine can carry out a number of different types of work, the core role of a 360 degree excavator is to &#39;dig&#39; or &#39;shape&#39; ground to, for example, form trenches for underground pipes, form earthwork embankments and will further load vehicles such as dumpers/dump trucks with earth that has been dug. The dumper will be loaded with earth from the excavator which is then transported across a site and tips the earth from the machine to form stockpiles or tip into an open trench. A ride in roller ‘rolls’ and compacts materials such as earth and tarmac for roads, paths etc. by being driven forward and backwards on a defined pattern, which compacts the material according to a specification. Forklifts in essence pick up a range of construction materials (usually on pallets) using the forks of the machine and transports them around a site, placing their load at various locations, sometimes to heights of 17 metres or more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On this apprenticeship, the operative will further undertake a range of non-operational activities with each machine such as the checking, maintaining and cleaning of their machine. They will also learn to direct and guide other plant and vehicles; for example, directing the driver of a dump truck where to position themselves when being loaded by the excavator and will further learn how to signal and marshal other plant and vehicles undertaking site deliveries, carry out checks on the work they do and finally help load their plant onto or off a transporter when being delivered to another site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this occupation, the operative will work on construction and civil engineering sites and will be required to travel to and from the site either on a daily or weekly basis. The operative may work on infrastructure projects such as a new motorway or high-speed rail line, giving the operative the opportunity to be involved in high-profile national projects. They will work alongside other workers such a ground workers who directly help the plant operator by, for example, providing signals and attaching and detaching ancillary equipment. The plant operative however remains in principle ultimately responsible for the execution and completion of the tasks they are undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of different stakeholders, including the following: the client; contractors/customers; members of the public; supervisors; other trades/occupations; supporting occupations (banksman, mechanics etc.); managers; suppliers; safety professionals; manufacturers and administration staff. They will work exclusively in an outdoor environment in all seasons and weathers, and at variable times which may include overnight, weekend and anti-social hours work to complete projects which have fixed completion timescales such as roadworks, rail maintenance etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for preparing, setting up and operating a number of designated construction plant types according to a site plan/method of work and in most cases will be under direct and indirect supervision. However, they will be in many cases be the lead operative working with supporting staff and the only worker who has full understanding of their machine’s capabilities and limitations. Operating plant is a safety critical activity and means that the actions of the operative has a direct and significant consequence to the safety and welfare of others, including the general public, for which a very high level of burden and responsibility comes with this occupation.&lt;/p&gt;",
