  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The occupation is found in the fields of design and technology across every sector, including digital and creative; retail and sales; public service; health innovation; manufacturing; and finance and professional services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to investigate, analyse and design the experience that people have with digital products and services, both current and emerging, in order to find ways that these interactions can be implemented, improved and optimised over time. Digital User Experience (UX) Professionals are responsible for the continuous improvement of the experiences that digital products and services offer to their users, and for leading and advocating the use of user-centred design practices within multidisciplinary teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, a Digital UX Professional interacts with internal and external parties including stakeholders (to capture organisational requirements and present solutions to UX challenges), users/customers (to understand their needs and validate UX solutions through user testing) and team members from a range of specialist fields including designers, developers, engineers, analysts and project/delivery managers (to ensure the effective implementation of UX solutions). Their work is typically office-based however field-based research and testing may require Digital UX Professionals to spend periods of time working in the environments of the users whose needs they are seeking to meet.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading the application of user-centred design methodologies, tools and techniques across the full lifecycle of digital product/service design and delivery, from research and development, through continuous improvement, to product/service retirement. They work both autonomously and as part of wider multidisciplinary teams, typically reporting to Product Owner/Creative Director/Head of User Experience roles.&lt;/p&gt;",
