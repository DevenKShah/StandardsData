  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Healthcare support workers (HCSWs) work as part of a team providing high quality and compassionate care to individuals(&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;). You will carry out well-defined routine clinical duties(&lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt;)&#160; like monitoring an individual’s conditions (by checking things like blood pressure, temperature or weight), checking on their overall progress, comfort and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on where you work, you may also help them to eat, drink, wash, dress or go to the toilet. &#160;You will prepare individuals for healthcare activities carried out by other members of the healthcare team, looking after them before, during and/or after those activities in line with their care plan. You will also carry out non-clinical duties and, depending on where you work, this could include things like keeping records, making beds, tidying up your work area, returning or cleaning the equipment used during a clinical activity. You will be able to address straightforward problems in your day to day work, reporting concerns and changes to the appropriate person in a timely manner .&#160; HCSWs work in a range of healthcare settings(&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;) and your team may include workers from both health and social care. You will report to a registered healthcare practitioner who will directly or indirectly supervise your work.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duty of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will be able to work effectively as part of a team. You will always act within the limits of your competence, knowing who to ask for help and support if you are not sure. You will work within agreed ways of working, following the relevant standards, policies and protocols used in your workplace including the Code of Conduct for Healthcare Support Workers and Adult Social Care Workers in England. During the first part of this apprenticeship you will be supported to achieve the Care Certificate(&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;) which forms part of your&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;induction and covers the fundamental skills needed to provide quality care.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There are no entry requirements to the apprenticeship but employers may run their own selection process. Apprentices without Level 1 English and Maths will need to achieve this level and take the test for Level 2 English and Maths prior to completion of their Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Level&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Level 2&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Duration&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;12 to 18 months&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Review Date&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;After 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Values&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will be caring and compassionate; honest;&#160;conscientious and committed&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;You will treat people with dignity, respecting individual&#39;s diversity, beliefs, culture, values, needs, privacy and&#160;preferences; show respect and empathy for those you work with; have the courage to challenge areas of concern and work to best practice; be adaptable, reliable and consistent; show discretion; show resilience and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;102&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;strong&gt;Skill&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;269&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;329&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;102&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.
