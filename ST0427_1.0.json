  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3 class=&quot;western&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an island nation over 95% of trade by volume goes by vessel through over 100 ports around the United Kingdom. Approximately 750 Marine Pilots are employed to safely navigate these vessels from sea to berth or berth to sea within the ports jurisdiction. A Marine Pilot has responsibility for the safe navigational conduct of a vessel throughout its passage from sea to berth or berth to sea. They also have a statutory duty to report any defects or deficiencies on the piloted vessel. A Marine Pilot will work closely with the Captain and other members of the crew, who may be of any nationality. They must also be able to use the vessels navigational and communications equipment, liaising with other vessels and the harbour marine control centre. Before boarding a vessel, a Marine Pilot is required to prepare a passage plan for the voyage from sea to berth or berth to sea. This will take into account the size, draft and operating characteristics of the vessel as well as tides, the marine environment and the weather and give consideration to any need for tugs to assist the manoeuvring.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Marine Pilot must be able to respond to emergency situations. They must know and adhere to safe navigational, vessel handling and environmental working practices and international regulations without endangering themselves, the vessel, its crew or the marine environment. A Marine Pilot must be able to climb/descend a vertical rope ladder from/to a launch holding position alongside a moving vessel, often in rough weather. They must be able to use survival techniques in water.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Marine Pilot typically works shifts to ensure they take regulated rest hours. They must have local knowledge of the waters, navigation and environment in which they will carry out acts of pilotage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;western&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship will require rigorous and substantial training, typically of around 30 – 36 months, depending on experience at entry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills Knowledge and Behaviours Skills &lt;/strong&gt;– The ability to&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Plan an Act of Pilotage&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Embark and Disembark a vessel whilst underway and whilst alongside&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Assess standards on the piloted vessel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Work effectively with the bridge team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Liaise and communicate within the port jurisdiction, including correct use of the vessels communication and navigational equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Safely transit the pilotage district&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Manoeuvre vessels in harbours and their approaches&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Respond to problems and emergency situations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Manage personal &amp;amp; professional conduct &amp;amp; development&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4 class=&quot;western&quot; lang=&quot;en-GB&quot;&gt;Knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Navigation, bridge equipment and navigational aids&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Weather, and the effects of wind and current on the vessel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Vessel handling and hydrodynamics including towage where required&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Bridge resource management&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Local, national and international legislation, codes of practice and guidance; for example knowing how and when to report deficiencies of the pilotage vessel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Vessels systems, including stability, strength, and construction&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Emergency response and personal safety&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Correct communications (e.g. vessel to vessel, vessel to shore) using standard marine vocabulary in relation to completing an act of pilotage safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Health, Safety and survival techniques&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Marine environmental protection including responsibility to the vessel and port jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Different types and designs of vessel&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Constraints and limitations of other craft on the water&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p lang=&quot;en-GB&quot; align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;Planning an act of pilotage from boarding to disembarkation.
