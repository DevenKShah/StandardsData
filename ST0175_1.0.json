  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role, occupation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced credit controller and Debt collection specialist&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit management and debt collection is a dynamic function found across all sectors of UK and international commerce. Given the importance of credit management and debt collection, roles are central to many operations, typically setting policies, facilitating sales, managing financial risk and customer relationships. Credit management typically manages and protects cash flow, while debt collection focuses on overdue, late or unpaid money owed to the organisation. Roles are generally fast-paced and target driven, requiring detailed knowledge of law, regulations and the business environment, and skilled practitioners possess excellent technical and interpersonal skills. They are rewarding career choices for self-motivated and enthusiastic individuals who would enjoy a varied role working at the centre of operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within this, the focus of the Advanced Credit Controller and Debt Collection Specialist role is typically to work with internal and external customers, both commercial and/or consumer, to ensure that the cash flow of their organisation is maximised while achieving fair customer outcomes. This requires proactive complex interaction with customers who are high risk due, to e.g. having multiple debts, consistently reaching credit limits or breaching credit agreements, missing repayments to minimise and/or recover bad debts while retaining positive sustained relationships. The range of activities is outlined in the examples contained in the Standard below. In addition to the core requirements of the apprenticeship, one of three specialist options must be completed. These are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Credit risk – advising on credit policy and making decisions on credit limits and in some cases complex and non-routine credit arrangements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced Collections – managing complex customer relations to resolve payment issues or identify potential customer vulnerability through the use of recognised relevant assessment frameworks (e.g. TEXAS Model, Common Financial Statement, understanding of insolvency legislation). Examples might include significant corporate business or customers in complex financial difficulties or vulnerable circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enforcement and recovery – applying in-depth understanding of statutory and/or non-statutory enforcement solutions in the recovery of debt&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Requirements – Core knowledge, skills and behaviours for an advanced credit controller and debt collection specialist:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ecialist:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 436px;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 42px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;height: 42px; width: 109px;&quot; width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;height: 42px; width: 355px;&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 62px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 62px;&quot; width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Credit Manag’t and debt collection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 62px;&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good understanding of the principles of credit management and debt collection together with a sound understanding of organisational policies and techniques used in their role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot; width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Legal, regulatory and compliance&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good understanding of the legal, regulatory, risk and compliance framework within which they operate, with a sound understanding of relevant legal, risk and compliance requirements for their role, e.g. relevant commercial or consumer credit law, credit management policies, data protection, treating customers fairly, complaints handling, potentially fraudulent transactions, including anti-money laundering arrangements and relevant financial and/or sector regulatory requirements depending on the focus of their role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot; width=&quot;109&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry and organisation understanding&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;height: 104px;&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understands professional standards; the commercial context, nature and priorities of the organisation they work in; the end to end customer journey; how customers manage their money, e.g. as individuals or businesses; organisational ‘values’; and where their role fits in the organisation.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Credit management and debt collection is a dynamic function found across all sectors of UK and international commerce. Given the importance of credit management and debt collection, roles are central to many operations, typically setting policies, facilitating sales, managing financial risk and customer relationships. Credit management typically manages and protects cash flow, while debt collection focuses on overdue, late or unpaid money owed to the organisation. Roles are generally fast-paced and target driven, requiring detailed knowledge of law, regulations and the business environment, and skilled practitioners possess excellent technical and interpersonal skills. They are rewarding career choices for self-motivated and enthusiastic individuals who would enjoy a varied role working at the centre of operations. Role Profile: Within this, the focus of the Advanced Credit Controller and Debt Collection Specialist role is typically to work with internal and external customers, both commercial and/or consumer, to ensure that the cash flow of their organisation is maximised while achieving fair customer outcomes. This requires proactive complex interaction with customers who are high risk due, to e.g. having multiple debts, consistently reaching credit limits or breaching credit agreements, missing repayments to minimise and/or recover bad debts while retaining positive sustained relationships. The range of activities is outlined in the examples contained in the Standard below. In addition to the core requirements of the apprenticeship, one of three specialist options must be completed. These are: Credit risk – advising on credit policy and making decisions on credit limits and in some cases complex and non-routine credit arrangements. Advanced Collections – managing complex customer relations to resolve payment issues or identify potential customer vulnerability through the use of recognised relevant assessment frameworks (e.g. TEXAS Model, Common Financial Statement, understanding of insolvency legislation). Examples might include significant corporate business or customers in complex financial difficulties or vulnerable circumstances. Enforcement and recovery – applying in-depth understanding of statutory and/or non-statutory enforcement solutions in the recovery of debt&lt;/p&gt;",
