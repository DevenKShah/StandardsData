  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Operational Delivery Officers have the vital job of keeping the country running. They make sure that citizens get the services and protection they need, and help people understand what is available and what they need to do to comply with the rules. Operational Delivery Officers make a difference every day to the lives of millions of people. They do hundreds of jobs in most departments and agencies in central government. They also work in local government, delivering services for towns, cities, boroughs or counties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship will give you great development opportunities to equip you to be an internationally-recognised professional in the part of the Civil Service that really makes things happen for customers and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Apprentices will do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A career in operational delivery is varied and involves working on the front line in different public-facing environments. You will be dealing with different types of customers and delivering a range of public services, but the skills and behaviours you need will be the same whatever you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Operational Delivery Officer roles include bringing data and evidence together, and making sure it is correct. You may also be considering applications, analysing information and making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Duties will depend on who the public service employer is and what they are responsible for: you could find yourself working in any occupational delivery area of central or local government.
