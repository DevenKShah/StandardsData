Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building Services Engineering makes buildings work. &#160;It is a specialist branch of engineering within the construction sector. Craftspersons &lt;strong&gt;u&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ndertake the installation, testing, pre-commissioning, commissioning and decommissioning of large-scale engineering systems &lt;/strong&gt;which are used for heating workplaces such as those found in industrial and commercial buildings like office blocks, factories, schools and hospitals. These engineering systems operate by moving temperature-controlled water around the inside of buildings, providing heating and cooling, and utilise fossil fuels and sustainable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Craftspersons have &lt;strong&gt;detailed knowledge &lt;/strong&gt;of the system’s operating principles. They also:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;set, identify and establish the requirements of the job, whether from drawings or client’s other instructions;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;liaise and work with other trades, suppliers and clients, as appropriate;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;solve problems within the scope of the work they carry out;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;undertake work to comply with all relevant standards;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;plan and monitor work programmes for installing, testing, pre-commissioning, commissioning and decommissioning systems;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;contribute to adjusting the configuration of systems as they are installed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They are able to demonstrate competence in the health and safety, communication, quality control and environmental requirements appropriate to their scope of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Craftspersons are able to work within new build construction sites and existing buildings &lt;strong&gt;on their own&lt;/strong&gt;, proficiently and &lt;strong&gt;without supervision&lt;/strong&gt;, in the most efficient and economical manner.

All will have achieved English at level 2, Mathematics at level 2 and ICT at level 1 by the end of the apprenticeship. Additionally, all apprentices must achieve the Level 3 Heating and Ventilating Craftsperson qualification prior to undertaking the end-point synoptic assessment with an independent assessment organisation.
