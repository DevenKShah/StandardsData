  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering (AME) sector.&#160; AME includes Aerospace, Automotive, Maritime Defence, Nuclear and Construction sectors. Machining technicians produce complex and precision machined products that are typically used in machinery. For example, aeroplanes and vehicles. They can also produce bespoke components or products for domestic appliances or medical equipment. They use a variety of machines to carry out their work. For example, centre lathes, vertical and horizontal milling machines, horizontal and cylindrical grinding machines. Electro discharge machines, single and multi-axis Computer Numeric Control (CNC) machine tools centres.&#160; Gear cutting and Gear Grinding machines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to produce complex and precision work by machining components. Components are machined from metal or specialist materials using conventional or CNC machine tools. Machining Technicians interpret information and plan their activities. They also set up, operate, adjust or edit machine tool settings. When using CNC equipment, they can produce, prove or edit programmes. They inspect components and machinery, report issues and support continuous improvement activities. They typically work in a manufacturing environment. Depending on the organisation, they may be required to work at height or work shifts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other Machining Technicians. They also interact with various stakeholders. They typically report to an engineering or manufacturing team leader. Typically, this would be as part of a defined or cross functional team. They may also interact with customers, suppliers, colleagues, quality auditors and regulators. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the quality and accuracy of their work. They also must work efficiently and be productive in the work they undertake.&#160; They must work both individually and as part of a larger team. They must work within the relevant health, safety and environmental regulations. This includes the use of appropriate protective clothing and equipment.&#160; They are responsible for the correct use and housekeeping of machinery, tools and equipment. All work must be completed in a safe and efficient manner as directed by supervisory staff.&lt;/p&gt;",
