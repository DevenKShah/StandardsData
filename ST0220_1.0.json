The clinical scientific environment determines the context of the HCS Associate work/role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duties of the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Associates work within a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) within the limits of their competence, and must seek help and support whenever this is required. They must be aware of the requirements of &lt;em&gt;Good Scientific Practice (GSP), &lt;/em&gt;which articulates the standards for the HCS profession and upon which this apprenticeship standard is based &lt;strong&gt;(3)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Using these professional standards, the HCS Associate must adhere to employers’ policies/protocols to ensure safe, person-centred/consistent practice in HCS working environments, including paying close attention to detail, working effectively within a team and acting as a role model for more junior members of staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While not exhaustive, activities undertaken by HCS Associates within the specific area/environment of HCS within which they work will include: supporting the development and maintenance of standards/protocols as required;&#160; contributing to the safe, effective and efficient functioning of diagnostic/therapeutic services;&#160;supporting more junior staff in learning required skills and behaviours of those who work in HCS; quality controlling the technical processing of biological samples and physiological and other diagnostic tests; performing routine investigations and telephoning authorised &lt;strong&gt;(4)&lt;/strong&gt; results according to protocols, e.g. in the Life Sciences, full blood counts/microscopy, antibiotic sensitivities/assays, endocrine assessments, immunology assays; in the Physiological Sciences: fitting/removing ambulatory blood pressure monitors and 24-hr ECGs; ophthalmic assessments of the structure and function of the eye; pure tonal audiometry; in the Physical Sciences: nuclear medicine imaging, post processing of images; decontaminating, repairing and maintaining medical devices, e.g. in Clinical Engineering medical device maintenance/calibration (including electro-medical); managing technical data and writing technical reports, e.g. in Clinical Bioinformatics which uses specifically designed methods/software for managing biological data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of the apprenticeship individuals will be eligible to join the Academy for HCS’s (AHCS) accredited Associate Register at Level 4 &lt;strong&gt;(5)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AHCS will require the Level 4 Diploma in HCS as an underpinning qualification for the HCS Associate apprenticeship.
