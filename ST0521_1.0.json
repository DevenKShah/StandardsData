  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Insulation Technicians apply multi-layer applications of specialist insulation systems, comprising of layers of high performance insulation, vapour barriers and weatherproof cladding. Thermal Insulation Technicians create bespoke patterns using technical drawing equipment to fabricate specialist cladding materials, which are applied on top of specialist insulation systems to complex pipework, ductwork and vessels. The cladding material is required to protect the equipment from environmental damage and for personnel protection from very hot or very cold surface temperatures, whilst maintaining the equipment within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Insulation Technicians can expect to work in a supervisory capacity, mentoring and advising other operatives and assisting with the management of projects. They will ensure the appropriate standard and quality of work is maintained and that it conforms to the design specifications, taking any corrective actions they consider necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Insulation Technicians may work on a diverse range of sites including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Power Generation, Nuclear, Oil and Gas sites&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Petrochemical and Process Plants including Food, Brewing and Dairy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shipyards&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working wherever pipework and services are located i.e. inside the plant or outside on the wider site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of a Thermal Insulation Technician includes the procurement of appropriate resources, the scheduling of work activities and quality assurance, in addition to the installation and application of appropriate insulation and cladding materials. They will identify the working area, variations in temperature and changing site conditions through a process of consultation with the client and appraisal of project drawings and information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Insulation Technicians will require a comprehensive understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the accurate interpretation of relevant product information and design specifications in line with changing external environmental weather conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to use technical drawing equipment to calculate the quantity, length and area of materials to be used in order to minimise wastage of resources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the process used to design and develop patterns from which to fabricate sheet cladding materials, to fit complex shapes and surfaces in line with specifications and project drawings&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;understand the specific project procurement processes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;jointing, sealing, weatherproofing and fitting specialist insulation

and vessels, for insulation and personnel protection&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;install insulation systems using staggered and grooved joints that fit together precisely&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;resize and re-configure cladding components on site when required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;use specialist hand tools and equipment including: swagers, lockformers, dividers, metal shears, mole grips, metal folders, metal rollers, drills and safe blades&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work reliably and safely, without close supervision, to approved industry standards and safe working practices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;work

conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Insulation Technicians are expected to demonstrate the following behaviours:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;act
