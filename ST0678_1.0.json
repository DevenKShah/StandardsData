  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The Technical dyer and colourist occupation is found within the textile manufacturing sector. The broad purpose of the occupation is to produce highly specialised dyes and colours to provide dye and colour chemistry in the production of textiles, apparel, upholstery and fashion fabrics. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide variety of individuals from the most senior technologists, leaders and directors, to shop floor operatives. Technical Dyers and Colourists work in a factory environment, interchanging between manufacturing facilities and laboratories. Almost all their work is indoors and within a controlled environments where they deal with customers by telephone or email over technical data/job sheets. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for the exact scientific analysis, accurate measurements, trials, production and quality of dyed, pigmented and colour applications to clothing in a heavily industrialised/mechanised scenario. They work in a senior role and lead a team of dyehouse operatives. They report directly to senior management and directors and have overall scrutiny and responsibility for the accuracy of manufactured products within the dyeing and colouration environment. Technical Dyers and Colourists are employed across micro businesses, SMEs and large businesses, ranging from small dyehouse businesses to large chemical, clothing and retail brand businesses.&lt;/p&gt;",
