Appliances can include, but are not limited to, a range of work categories such as central heating boilers, unvented hot water storage, ducted air heaters, cookers, space heaters, meters, alternative fuel, boosters, testing and purging for industrial pipework. &#160;Roles in gas engineering will include explaining how installations and appliances work, providing energy efficiency advice and ensuring customer service excellence at all times. Gas engineering operates strictly within the requirements of health and safety legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Roles in gas engineering are physical in nature, and may involve lifting and moving of equipment, working at heights and working in confined spaces. All gas engineers must be registered on the Gas Safe&#174; Register for each appliance in which they are competent to undertake work on.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants will normally have gained a minimum of 3-5 GCSEs (grade A-C) or equivalent, preferably English, mathematics and a science or relevant / appropriate experience. Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprenticeship and will include a recognised background check, equivalent to Criminal Record Bureau/Disclosure and Barring Service (CRB/DBS).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Those who work within Gas engineering must have the core requirements below and demonstrate the technical requirements in one setting – domestic or non-domestic. They must be registered on the Gas Safe&#174; Register for four appliances.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements - Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Current Health, Safety and Environmental legislation and regulations applicable to work in the gas industry&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Safe gas and electrical installation, commissioning, decommissioning and/or ongoing service and repair procedures of gas installations and appliances needed to establish the safe operation of the equipment and installation in accordance with industry standards&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Gas and electrical theories and procedures involved in the practical installation, commissioning, decommissioning and/or ongoing service and repair of gas installations, appliances and associated equipment&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant electrical/mechanical principles and how they are applied in work processes and procedures&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Up to date energy efficiency advice and guidance to be given to the customer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Product knowledge to be able to discuss and advise the customer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Current regulatory compliance, current Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations and the current Electricity at Work Regulations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Company rules, policies and procedures as defined by the employer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Requirements -
