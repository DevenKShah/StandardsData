  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Floorlayer is a trained craftsperson who will be involved with the installation of either carpets, vinyl, linoleum and rubber or laminate and wood flooring and will work for large and small employers in all types of buildings within a diverse range of commercial and domestic environments. Buildings may be existing or new and part of a construction site, such as housing estates, schools, shops, hospitals, airports or more iconic buildings such as the Shard or the Olympic Stadium in London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Floorlayer works in an efficient and safe manner, and ensure high levels of customer care, particularly within the domestic environment; working alone or within a team. The type of floorcovering will vary from basic to designer installations, thus working with a diverse range of materials and designs, and being one of the finishing trades, will significantly contribute to the ‘look and feel’ of a building and can provide great personal satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main duties and tasks include preparing the work area and sub-floor to a suitable standard to enable the following installation of floorcoverings to the clients specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Floorlayers need to be good at communicating, able to interact effectively with colleagues, clients and associated trades e.g. plumbers, electricians, painters. They must also be able to interpret drawings and extract relevant information to complete the installation of the flooring, but be flexible, in adapting their approach and techniques when faced with unexpected site conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship consists of a core and options and apprentices are required to select one option depending upon their job role. The occupations covered by this standard are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Textile &amp;amp; Resilient Floorlayer – prepares subfloors and installs textile floorcoverings (g. carpet from a roll and carpet tiles) and also resilient floorcoverings (e.g. vinyl, linoleum and rubber, in sheet and tile formats)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wood Floorlayer – prepares subfloors and installs laminate and wood flooring in various formats.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Completion of the apprenticeship will allow individuals to meet the requirements (Skilled Worker) of construction industry registration schemes (Construction Skills Certification Scheme – CSCS).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;
