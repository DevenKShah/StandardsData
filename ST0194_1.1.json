  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in small, medium, and large employers such as high-street, mobile and supermarket fishmongers, wholesalers, fish merchants and primary fish processors. Fish wholesalers and processors range from multi-national processing businesses supplying fish or fish products to large food outlets, supermarkets, and hotel chains; to smaller fish processors supplying independent or local food businesses.

They are up to date on the latest developments in the industry, such as traceability systems, certifications, and ethics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship, with two options and the option taken is dependent on the specialist nature of the employer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 1 - the broad purpose of a retail fishmonger depends on the place of employment. In most retail establishments, they are responsible for receiving and storing fish products in accordance with food safety and health and safety regulations, to maintain the quality of the fish. They will hand prepare fish or shellfish for display and sale to members of the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, they may package and price fish items after cutting and preparing them for display.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 2 - the broad purpose of a fishmonger in a wholesaler or processer has a more diverse set of tasks. They will process fish or shellfish using a variety of hand tools and equipment. Specialist equipment may be used to break down, debone, cut, and trim fish or shellfish for retail or catering cuts. They will then be processed and/or sold to both domestic and international customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of stakeholders such as clients or customers, suppliers, enforcement agencies and regulators, and auditors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the cutting, preparing, packaging and presentation of fish or shellfish products to the standards required of the business and specialist needs of commercial customers, complying with all relevant legislation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 1 - in the retail environment, a fishmonger will be responsible for the preparation of fish or shellfish for display and sale to members of the public. They will receive, handle and store fish or shellfish in accordance with food safety and health and safety policies and regulations, maintaining the quality of their stock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Retail fishmongers will weigh, label and package fish or shellfish as part of the sale, and some fishmongers may also process payments. They will be responsible for maintaining the work area, the retail display, providing customer service, fish, or shellfish preparation, moving and handling product, stock management, providing information to customers and colleagues, cleaning, and raw materials intake. They will have customer service skills and work to meet their requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The working environment for a fishmonger in retail can range from a high street shop to a market stall, mobile fish van or supermarket. The working day is largely controlled by the presence or absence of customers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 2 - a fishmonger in a wholesaler or processer will process fish or shellfish using a variety of hand tools, equipment, and machinery. They will operate and monitor the operation of specialist machinery and equipment such as skinning machines, packaging and weighing equipment for the larger scale processing of fish or shellfish. This ensures that business standards for yield, throughput and quality are met. Ensuring that production flows meet organisational targets is an important part of their role, as is working in accordance with food safety and health and safety regulations and procedures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will be responsible for the cutting, preparing, packaging and presentation of fish or shellfish products to the standards required of the business and specialist needs of commercial customers, complying with all relevant legislation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A fishmonger in wholesaler or processer evaluates any rejected products for reuse or disposal as part of their role. They will work as a team to meet the specific requirements of customers such as hotels, restaurants, retailers, and schools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In processing plants, fishmongers often work on production lines. In these environments, workers may be exposed to cold temperatures, damp, and loud noise. They may well use high-risk machinery and need to wear full PPE and personal protective clothing (PPC) and observe food safety and health and safety legislation. The working environment for a wholesale fishmonger is fast paced whether they are working in a fish merchant, processor, or similar establishment. The working day is largely controlled by the targets set for production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this role an individual may work on their own or in a range of team settings. They work to agreed targets and available resources. They work with high levels of supervision, usually reporting to line managers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
