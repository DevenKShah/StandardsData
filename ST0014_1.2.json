They are expected to carry out approved scheduled maintenance processes and defect rectification within the limits of their authority, to maintain the airworthiness of the aircraft. It involves specialist work, maintaining aircraft serviceability according to approved requirements and work instructions, using relevant hand tools and equipment. They must comply with civil and or military regulatory and organisational requirements. They will demonstrate their ability to identify defects and problems using the appropriate processes and understand the limits of their authority/approval. They will understand why Standard Operating Procedures are produced for maintaining aircraft and the importance of using them. The Maintenance Mechanic will also assist Aircraft Maintenance Fitter/Technicians to carry out specialist work, maintaining aircraft systems according to approved requirements and work instructions. The Maintenance Mechanic will recognise and be able to work safely within the airworthiness environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aircraft Maintenance Mechanic, Aircraft Mechanic, Aviation Maintenance Mechanic (Military) and Avionics Mechanic&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Requirements (Knowledge and Skills)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are different organisational (military) requirements which need a range of options depending upon the employer context.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complying with statutory, quality and organisational requirements for aviation safety and occupational health and safety while carrying out aircraft maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Human Factors in aviation – developing an understanding of attitudes and behaviours to ensure aviation safety&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Aircraft Flight-Line maintenance, handling and operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Understand the fundamentals of Airframe Structural Inspection and Husbandry&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and use Aircraft Publications, raise and complete Service and Maintenance Documentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Safe selection and use of hand and mechanical tools and equipment while carrying out maintenance of aircraft&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use of basic measuring and or test equipment while carrying out aircraft maintenance activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use of ground support equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r Selected Options (Select two from the options below)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Options are available through the Apprenticeship depending on the context of the employer’s business, whether in civil or military aviation, rotary or fixed wing aircraft, in workshop, line or base maintenance.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the engineering sector, in the aviation industry.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aviation maintenance mechanics are found across the aviation sector. They can be found within both military and civilian organisations. They carry out inspections for maintenance on fixed wing and rotary aircraft (small aeroplanes to airliners, jet fighters and helicopters).&#160; Employers vary in size from small to large.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to perform inspections for maintenance on aeroplanes and helicopters.&#160; Aviation maintenance mechanics carry out pre and post flight inspection for maintenance. They prepare, and safety check the work area. They plan the activity and carry out airworthiness inspections for maintenance, such as replenishments. They assist with aircraft ground handling and complete documentation. They also ensure that the work area is restored on completion of the maintenance activity.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aviation maintenance mechanics are required to work in a regulated engineering environment. Depending on the activity they may work inside or outdoors. This could include hangars, dispersals, gates, aprons, workshops, and on ships. It may also include areas away from airfields or airports.&#160; Work may involve maintenance on a variety of aircraft or aircraft components.&#160; They may be required to work shifts and in hazardous areas. For example, working at height, noisy environments or in confined spaces.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, people in this occupation interact with other aviation maintenance mechanics, engineers, operators, and supply chain staff.&#160; They also interact with various stakeholders including flight crew, shift leaders, colleagues, and regulators.&#160; They work individually or as part of the larger team. This depends on the size and structure of the organisation.&#160; They typically work under both supervised and unsupervised direction of an engineer, technician, or supervisor.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation is responsible for complying with regulatory and organisational requirements.&#160; They must follow organisationally defined and approved procedures when working on aircraft or aircraft systems. They must work within the specified organisational health, safety, and environmental regulations.&#160; They must use the appropriate protective clothing, equipment, and resources.&#160; They are responsible for the correct use and control of tools and equipment. All work must be completed safely and efficiently as directed by supervisory staff.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
