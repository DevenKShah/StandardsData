  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of the Role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Heavy Vehicle (HV) technician services, inspects and repairs HVs, categorised by the Department&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;of Transport as category N2 or N3, and associated trailers, with the associated ancillaries. They work in either a dealership that focusses on a particular manufacturer, or for an independent garage, franchise or large fleet operator that deals with many different makes of vehicles. They work on all the systems found within the vehicle. The nature of the work ranges from replacing simple parts through to solving complex faults with the use of diagnostic methods and equipment. The day-to-day tasks faced by the technician are constantly changing, driven by the introduction of ever more complex technologies and diagnostic techniques. Today’s technician has to demonstrate expertise in the technical side of their role. They must have strong problem-solving skills and a good grasp of the theoretical and practical aspects of vehicles systems and associated ancillaries. They must be able to work independently but also operate as an effective team member, understanding how their workshop and the dealership/garage/branch functions from a commercial perspective, have good customer handling skills and identify ways in which they can work more efficiently. The growing complexity of today’s vehicles and the pressure to deliver a high-quality customer experience requires the retail automotive sector to attract and train high calibre individuals and this is reflected in the elements of the Standard described below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programme Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically it is expected that it will take three years for the apprentice to attain the required level of competence in the workplace although it may be sooner if an individual already has significant training and practical experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set their own selection criteria for the applicants. It is however recommended that to optimise the chance of selection, &#160;candidates can demonstrate an interest in how the HV industry operates as well as ability to work in an organised and methodical way to analyse and solve problems; be able to demonstrate mechanical skills; also demonstrate an ability to communicate both orally and in writing. &#160;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completion of their apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A heavy vehicle service and maintenance technician will demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The fundamentals of HV technologies e.g. HV chassis design, engine, fuels, transmissions, electrical (12/24v), air-conditioning, hydraulic and air braking, air suspension systems etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The types and associated characteristics of HV and their configurations and applications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Diagnosing principles and logical problem solving techniques related to HV.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sufficient H&amp;amp;S knowledge and environmental awareness to carry out the work safely.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operators “O” Licence requirements relating to HVs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to service, inspect and maintain vehicles and trailers to the expected standards and the importance of safety inspection and maintenance schedules to meet Operator’s (O) licence and legal obligations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Customer expectations and implications of work carried out.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The need to be reliable, flexible, diligent and good timekeeper.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How the business works from an operational perspective and demonstrate commercial and financial awareness in the HV industry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complex problem solving techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The requirements of providing roadside assistance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e competency to achieve the following skills in the workplace:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out the basic tasks with tools and equipment common to all procedures involving basic mechanical and electrical procedures related to HV.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to keep updated with emerging new technologies within the HV industry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the maintenance of a safe and efficient workshop and adhere to the company and legislative processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Access specific and related HV technical information appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to service, inspect and maintain HVs and trailers to meet company, Driver and vehicle standards agency (DVSA) and manufacturers’ standards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a range of diagnostic and electrical measuring equipment to identify faults and underlying causes on HV’s.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Successfully inspect and prepare vehicles and trailers to meet DVSA standards prescribed in the tester’s manual.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out final quality checks before handover to the customer without supervision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply advanced diagnostic principles and logical/problem solving techniques and regimes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain records to company and operators’ licence obligations and regulation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To be able to communicate effectively in both oral and written mediums both internally and with customers on a range of topics that will support, HV inspection and diagnosing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required behaviours to achieve the following in the workplace:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Behave in accordance with the values of the company they work for whether manufacturer or independent to treat customers and stakeholders with courtesy and respond quickly to their requirements to ensure an excellent experience.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Operate effectively as a team member taking ownership and responsibility when required and be honest and accountable in all activities when things do not go as planned.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To work at continuous development of both self, team and processes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression, Qualification and Professional Body:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard has been designed to meet the professional standards of the relevant professional bodies of the Engineering Council for initial registration as an Engineering Technician (Eng. Tech).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of the standard the Engineering Technician will be eligible to apply for registration as an Engineering Technician with a relevant professional body. On completion and achievement of the standard, candidates will have the opportunity to progress to Master Technician, management or to develop in their current role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tandard Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprenticeship should be reviewed after a maximum of 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s apprenticeship is set at level 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
