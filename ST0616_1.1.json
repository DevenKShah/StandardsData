  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;The Wireless Communications Rigger is a key member of the field-based wireless rigging team supporting the UK’s cellular network and its infrastructure. Comfortable working at height and outdoors in a physically-demanding role, Wireless Communications Riggers will be at the forefront of the nationwide roll-out of the 5G network whilst actively maintaining the existing 2G, 3G and 4G networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wireless Communications Riggers can install large steel structures on towers and rooftops, adapting the existing structure in the process if necessary. They facilitate the lifting and lowering of equipment for installation and removal, install a range of cable types and sizes including Coaxial, CAT5/6 and Fibre Optic, interpret drawings and plans, demonstrate a range of climbing techniques and can even rescue colleagues in difficulty at height.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wireless Communications Riggers work in a variety of environments including rooftop sites, towers and masts in greenfield sites or inner-city buildings. They must be equally adept working indoors or outdoors, in a variety of temperatures and weather conditions and sometimes at unsociable hours. Wireless Communications Riggers will generally form part of a 2 or 3-man team reporting to a team leader. They will be required to communicate effectively and sensitively with site providers, landlords and members of the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the UK embraces the digital economy, the dependence on wireless communication platforms to handle larger data packages, fast delivery and wider coverage continues. There are approximately 1500 –2000 climbers in the industry with businesses ranging in size from international mobile telecoms companies to smaller regional subcontractors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles: Wireless Communications Rigger, Rigging Engineer, Telecomms Rigger&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 666px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 17px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 20%;
