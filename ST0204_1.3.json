  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the utilities sector, in the gas transportation industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to construct, maintain and repair gas network infrastructure, to provide a reliable supply/service to domestic, commercial and industrial users. Infrastructure for gas transportation includes mains and services operating at below 7bar pressure, including excess flow valves, emergency control valves, pipes, network valves, top tee and encirclement fittings and branch saddles. Operatives ensure the site is safe for work and members of the public, which may include traffic management and control. They complete site excavation and on job completion, restore the site to a safe condition. They use a range of powered equipment, hand tools and plant on-site, for example diggers, rollers and forklifts. Responding to gas network infrastructure emergencies, for example gas escapes, in line with procedures and escalating as appropriate is all part of the role. Recording and reporting on work completed is important, which may include completion of paperwork or computerised records, drawings and providing site photographs.Depending on the work required, they may spend the day at one site or work across a number of sites. Work locations may include new build sites, public highways and domestic, industrial and commercial properties. They are required to work in all weather conditions. They may need to work shifts, standby and unsociable hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with with colleagues, such as managers, network technicians and engineers, delivery drivers, reinstatement teams and administration staff. They usually work in a small team - typically with one or two other operatives, responsible for their own work, reporting to managers but not under direct supervision. On a site they may also interact with site agents and other trades. They will communicate with clients/customers regarding work that is being undertaken and in some situations the general public. They may also liaise with personnel from statutory authorities, such as the Highways Authority, local authorities and the Environment Agency. When working in emergency situations, they may liaise with emergency services personnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing work to the required standard, following procedures, ensuring Health &amp;amp; Safety and regulatory compliance with OFGEM (Office of Gas and Electricity Markets), Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers (IGEM) standards and Environment Agency etc; failure to do so could have serious consequences for self, public health and the environment. They are expected to present a professional image of the company. They are responsible for ensuring their tools and equipment are fit for use and inspected prior to use, correctly stored and maintained. Depending on their level of experience, they may be responsible for leading the team.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gas network operatives need to be qualified and on the Street Works Register.&#160; Employers typically require a driving license, as operatives may be expected to drive to their place of work, using a company vehicle. In addition, some gas network operatives may require a CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) Card and/or SHEA (Safety, Health and Environmental Awareness) Gas Passport Card. A Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check may also be required.&lt;/p&gt;",
