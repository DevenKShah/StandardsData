  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in any employer in any sector that uses data to make business decisions. Data analysts may work in various departments within a single employer, (for example finance, sales, HR, manufacturing, or marketing), and in any employment sector, public or private, including retail, distribution, defence, banking, logistics, media, local government etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ascertain how data can be used in order to answer questions and solve problems. Data analysis is a process of requirement-gathering, inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names. In today&#39;s world, data analysis plays a crucial role in making decisions more evidence-based and helping organisations operate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example: a data analyst may investigate social media trends and their impact on the organisation. In retail, a data analyst may break down sales figures to make recommendations on product placement and development. In HR a data analyst may investigate staff retention rates, in order to decide on recruitment strategy. In a hospital, a data analyst may investigate wait times for different departments, in order to provide a better service to its patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with internal or external clients. Internally, the data analyst may work with many people within their organisation, at different levels. Externally a data analyst may provide data analysis services to other organisations on behalf of their employer. Data analysts would normally be office based and work normal business hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the creation and delivery of their own work, to meet business objectives. The data analyst will be responsible for working within the data architecture of the company and ensuring that the data is handled in a compliant, safe and appropriately secure manner, understanding and adhering to company data policy and legislation. Data analysis is a fast-moving and changing environment, and data analysts need to continue to stay abreast of, and engaged with, changes and trends in the wider industry; including data languages, tools and software, and lessons learnt elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;",

The dispensation will remain live until redundant apprentices identified in the dispensation request have completed their EPA, including any resits and retakes, when it will then be withdrawn. The end-point assessment organisation (EPAO) delivering the EPA for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required and agreed by IfATE, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider (EQAP).\nThe key changes are:\nThe Training Provider will step in as the employer for the duration of the EPA period in order to ensure that apprentices that have been made redundant can conduct their work based project and complete their apprenticeship.\nThe dispensation applies to the agreed apprentices only. EPAOs must contact IfATE for each individual case. If your organisation is planning delivery of this EPA, you should follow the requirements as detailed in the plan as the dispensation is intended to support specific apprentices only.\nPlease contact the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education via enquiries.ifa@education.gov.uk should you require any further clarity.; This apprenticeship is in the process of being revised or adjusted. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other apprenticeships being revised are available in the revisions status report.",
