  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in theatres, live entertainment venues, TV and film studios. The broad purpose of the occupation is to programme, operate and maintain automation systems to ensure they meet the requirements of a production by consistently fulfilling the artistic vision for it. The highest standards of safety, efficiency and technical standards must be achieved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic automation technicians consult and collaborate with other departments to carry out planning and work activities to meet performance requirements including timing and order of all mechanised set movements during a theatrical production or other live performance. They control scenery and other equipment on the stage or set and in the air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They support the running of shows including fit-ups, rehearsals, set changes, rotations and get-outs in all aspects of a show or production related automation. They work within the parameters which various environments dictate for example working at height or within confined spaces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They undertake the safe set-up operation, inspection and first line performance maintenance of specialist automation equipment for example electrical and hydraulic drives, winches, hoists, stage elevators, traps, revolves and associated controls ensuring technical staff and where they are present public safety at all times. They ensure that equipment is compliant with industry standards such as Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations (LOLER) and Provision and Use of Work Equipment and Regulations (PUWER). They may undertake stage or set rigging requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have excellent communication skills and a practical approach to problem solving. They are self-motivated as well as being a good team player. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the performance artists to make sure they understand their role and the impact of automation on their performance. They work with designers to understand the artistic vision. They work with other departments involved in the technical aspects of a production or performance for example lighting, projection, sound, engineering departments, scenic construction, technical and production managers, stage crew, stage managers, digital design team and the health and safety team. They may work in a team with other scenic automation technicians and may come in to contact with scenic automation suppliers. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for programming and safely operating automation control systems to achieve the artistic vision for the production or performance through automation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic automation technicians assemble and repair automated equipment for moving scenery or set elements as well as delivering planned maintenance of all stage or set machinery ensuring it is compliant to current regulations. Some scenic automation technicians may undertake emergency repairs and fixes during live performances&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are responsible for performer safety including those who may be flown or who are on a moving scenic item. They must ensure health and safety compliance including keeping up to date with regulations and industry developments&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will adapt their approach as the situation, circumstances or people change whilst achieving personal objectives set by their manager They are trusted to work unsupervised under the brief of their supervisor. They will be required to work during evenings and weekends during fit up and production periods.&lt;/p&gt;",
