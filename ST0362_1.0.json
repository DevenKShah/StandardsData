To meet these requirements many organisations will have dedicated Risk and/or compliance departments that are experts in the relevant legislation and regulator requirements. They provide proactive support and guidance to the business areas to ensure that the organisation meets this wide range of requirements, balanced against achieving appropriate customer outcomes. In some organisations, this expertise may be embedded in the business areas themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Compliance officer and Risk officer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the risk and compliance function of a specific organisation, the role of the compliance and risk officer is likely to include providing relatively straightforward support and advice to the business on their specific area(s) of expertise e.g. financial crime, training and competence, fraud; working with the business on specific problems that emerge; analysing data, maintaining records and producing reports; working on review and audits to check that policies are being correctly applied. The role will require sound ethical standards, together with good communication and influencing skills as there can be differences of opinion between the business and the risk and compliance function on the appropriate action to take. Sound underpinning knowledge of risk and compliance frameworks, policies and procedures will be required. The role may cover compliance or risk functions or be a blend of both depending on the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;y requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their apprenticeships.
