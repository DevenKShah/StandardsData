Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will identify any relevant entry requirements in terms of previous qualifications or other criteria. Our recommendation of entry requirements is below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GCSE Maths &amp;amp; English - grade C or above (or equivalent).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 x A Level (or equivalent) - minimum grade C&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following qualifications meet the requirements for the Trailblazer Apprenticeship for Paralegals. They do not represent an exhaustive list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CILEx Level 3 Diploma in Providing Legal Services&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Completing this standard should also provide exemptions for the Solicitor Apprentice standard and the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Legal Executive standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English &amp;amp; Maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the End-Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeship’s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed in three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ST0245changelog&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
