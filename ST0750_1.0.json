  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Construction. The broad purpose of the occupation is to lay mastic asphalt on to a wide range of surfaces and structures. The occupation requires knowledge of a unique material that is applied in a molten form, including an understanding of how it is correctly heated and agitated so that it is transformed from solid into the correct molten condition to be applied. Skills and knowledge must be developed to ensure the apprentice can select the correct tools and resources for use, and prepare surfaces for the effective application of asphalt. It is a skilled hand-craft that requires perfecting a range of techniques to apply asphalt to a variety of surfaces (including vertical, sloping and angled) to achieve proper adhesion; and a waterproof, seamless and smooth finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mastic Asphalter provides robust, flexible and long-lasting seamless waterproofing and protection to a variety of surfaces - particularly those exposed to the elements e.g. flat roofs; where high levels of footfall require a robust and waterproof finish e.g. balconies and walkways; to create asphalt membranes to ensures water tightness in damp conditions e.g. tanking for basements; and to create robust but aesthetic floor finishes e.g. Terrazzo flooring. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with Supervisors and Charge-Hands from their own company and colleagues who order materials and facilities. They liaise with site managers, surveyors, and other construction trades taking place alongside their work e.g. scaffolding, brickwork, carpentry. &lt;br /&gt;Employers range from SMEs to large national companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The work environment is wherever mastic asphalt is laid: roofs; balconies; basements; car parks; paving/bridges; and flooring, with volumes varying from 1 to 1000’s of square metres. The work is predominantly outside and often exposed to the elements. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring they have the correct materials, tools and facilities to undertake a project, conforming to health, safety and welfare requirements at all times. The employee will receive instruction from a Supervisor including more senior and experienced Mastic Asphalters / Charge-Hands, therefore they have limited autonomy in the workplace. The work place can be residential or commercial in nature, requiring awareness of the needs and safety of people living or working on or adjacent to the working environment. Organisations require the same mastic asphalt craft skills and knowledge. As a result the skills are transferable across the full range of companies employing Mastic Asphalters.&lt;/p&gt;",
