  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A software tester is found in any organisation that develops and applies software. This ranges from large multi-national organisations with dedicated teams of software testers to small consulting firms that work on a contract basis to deliver software testing services to a varied client base. For example, within financial services a software tester could be integral to testing software for delivering bespoke payroll or HR services whereas in a large corporate they could be providing consultancy services for global multi-national clients across a range of software products. Software Testers are responsible for ensuring that the software developed meets the business&#39;s functional, security, performance, and usability requirements by participating in development activity at all stages of the software development life cycle..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure that software operates as intended for Software development practices so that they understand the context in which they are operating. Software Testers are responsible for the quality of software development and&#160;deployment with a view to the commercial requirements of the client and their organisational parameters. Some of the duties include analysis of software and systems to mitigate the risk of software problems arising and making informed recommendations to internal and external clients. Software testers are involved particularly in the quality assurance stage of software development and deployment. They conduct manual and automated tests to ensure the software created by developers is fit for purpose and any bugs or issues are removed within a product before it gets deployed to everyday users. The Software Tester role is integral to the creation of software systems and technical&#160;products. A Software Tester might work on bespoke, individual projects creating enterprise solutions for email compliance and marketing. or multinational projects spanning the globe&#160;and costing billions of pounds. In a defence and security context they may interact with cyber security teams to ensure that software developed is secure from inception.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other members of software testing teams, other areas within the organisation&#39;s software development function and business areas commissioning software testing services, as well as external clients and other associated stakeholders. This is an office based or remote working role with some visits to client’s premises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working collaboratively within a team&#160;and with stakeholders with a minimum of direct supervision within broad but generally well defined parameters, A Software Tester will be required to apply their knowledge and skills in a broad range of&#160;complex or technical work activities, performed in a variety of contexts. They will address&#160;problems which are both routine and non-routine while normally fairly well defined. They&#160;will take responsibility for courses of action, including, where relevant, responsibility for the work of others and allocation of resources. They will typically pair with other technical roles such as software developers, or work alone at times, and provide input to the planning of work and advise on risks and improvements within software products.&lt;/p&gt;",
