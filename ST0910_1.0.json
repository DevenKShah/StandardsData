  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the manufacturing, creative and design sectors, in the production of knitted fabrics and knitted products. Products are used in the clothing, medical, construction and automotive industries. Products range from luxury apparel to fast fashion, plasters to implantable medical devices, pond liners to road underlay and car seat covers to engine components. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to create knitted components or products that meet customer and/or organisation specifications and quality standards. Knitting product manufacturing technicians may work on one-off items for specific customers, product samples to be replicated or on larger production runs. They use knitting methods such as flat knitting, circular knitting, warp knitting and weft knitting. Each method produces an entirely different finish. For example, weft knitting produces a shaped component, whilst warp knitting produces only fabric yardage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work to a high level of accuracy; with close attention to detail, following given design briefs, which include specifications. They select the raw materials and machines appropriate for the job, select a relevant programme and set up specialist knitting machines to produce the item to specifications. They oversee the machines as they knit the product, dealing with manufacturing, quality, operational and process issues throughout production. They understand the end-to-end knitting process and support continuous improvement work as needed. They carry out routine, preventative maintenance, fault find and rectify common issues on knitting machines, ensuring they deliver a consistent level of quality production. They work efficiently, sometimes working under pressure, to meet customer or production deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Employers vary in size from micro to large. Knitted product manufacturing technicians work in a production factory environment or a sample room with access to production facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their production manager or supervisor and personnel involved in the design, development and production of knitted products. This will vary depending on the business size, structure and working environment. Typically, in a small production unit, they would work with the designer and maybe the production manager. In a workshop producing bespoke knitwear, they may work with the designer and the sample maker. In a wider factory setting, they often report to a supervisor or production manager and may work as part of a larger team, consulting with design, development and production staff, to ensure specifications are met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for production of knitted products, implementing and overseeing efficient production methods, ensuring the knitted product meets the quality standard and design brief. They must work effectively on their own, or they may work as part of a wider team and must comply with health and safety requirements.&lt;/p&gt;",
