The effectiveness of that team depends on each individual’s selflessness placing the communal right over individual right. The Serviceperson must be prepared to undertake a diverse range of roles from general warfare to humanitarian tasks necessitating a high level of commitment, enthusiasm and common sense&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Each year, large numbers of new recruits enter the HM Forces undertaking programmes of training and skills development necessary to enable them to work in a variety of highly physically and mentally demanding situations and environments, often for prolonged periods. This requires the Serviceperson to have a high degree of physical and mental robustness as well as dedication and self discipline. A serviceperson must be able to understand and adapt to the changing needs of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;En&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;y Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the demanding nature of the role within the HM Forces, there are a number of entry restrictions relating to age, nationality, residency, gender, medical and physical fitness. Requirements vary between and within the single Services and are at times subject to change.

An apprentice who has already achieved a level 1 qualification must study towards the achievement of a level 2 GCSE (A*-C) or Level 2 Functional Skills qualification as part of the apprenticeship, but entry to final apprenticeship assessment is not dependent on passing these qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ogression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All apprentices are in full time employment within their Service.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the public sector only and specifically within HM Forces (Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force). The HM Forces is a large employer. The role is utilised by the ground troops of all three services, who could find their workplace to be UK based or on foreign soil, dependent on HM Government direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide defence to the United Kingdom, incorporating peace keeping duties such as United Nations Peacekeeping in Cyprus, support/assistance to civilian tasks for example building Nightingale Hospitals during the COVID epidemic, disaster relief for example helping to shore up river banks during major flooding within the UK, and working abroad as directed by HM Government. The HM Forces Serviceperson will be part of the first response ground troops from the Royal Navy, Army or Royal Air Force, who will be delivered to their designated area by sea, land or air, dependent on the location and service represented. They will work individually and as a team, potentially at all hours, in all weathers and across all terrains, as is required to fulfil the requirements of the specified organisational objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation typically interacts with colleagues and their line management chain from their relevant service (Royal Navy, Army, Royal Air Force). The HM Forces Serviceperson could be assigned to work within the wider HM Forces environment and may be required to take direction from line management of an alternative service or take direction from other nations or other government departments. This is dependent on the HM Forces Serviceperson&#39;s duties, tasks and locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring that all they have been taught is applied, enabling instinctive actions and reactions in appropriate controlled and measured ways.&amp;nbsp; For HM Forces Servicepersons, preparation is vital. They will carry out theoretical and practical training, which will include, but not exclusively, communication methods, enhanced first aid, safe weapons handling processes and navigation methods along with testing and maintenance of equipment to ensure operational preparedness. They are responsible for consistently working in a professional manner, both individually and as a team, continually honing the requisite skills in readiness for any eventuality they may be required to fulfil. They will become embedded into a professional culture and ethos where individuals understand / are aware of how their role supports both the team and aligns to the wider organisational taskings and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;",
