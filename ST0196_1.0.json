  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Section 1: Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Food and Drink Advanced Process Operators work in one of the largest, most dynamic and fastest growing sectors of industry. Every day, producers, manufacturers and retailers make and sell millions of innovative food products to consumers in the UK and around the world. This includes drinks, cakes, biscuits, ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook food, sandwiches, wraps, fresh fruit and salads. It is imperative that apprentices in the industry have the skills and knowledge to ensure our food products, which millions of people consume every day, are safe.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Operators work in the manufacturing sector of the food and drink industry. They typically work on production lines in manufacturing plants, but will spend some time offline while working on activities such as new product development. They have both knowledge and skills in preventative maintenance activities and Continuous Improvement (CI) techniques, which are essential to maintaining and improving productivity in food and drink manufacturing sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whichever part of the industry they choose to work in, on completion of this programme, the individual will be able to evaluate and make improvements to safety, quality and performance in a food and drink manufacturing environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Operators will develop an in-depth knowledge of food and drink products, health and safety systems, quality systems and Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP). They are trained to interrogate and interpret data to identify trends and carry out basic fault finding. This will help to avoid future faults and improve quality and productivity. Advanced Operators may be expected to lead others; as such they will develop skills in leadership and management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this programme, individuals may progress into more advanced technical or leadership roles. This apprenticeship is an ideal spring board for potential future leaders of the food and drink industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Section 2: The Knowledge, Skills and Behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Food and Drink Advanced Process Operators will have the following knowledge and understanding:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table width=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 106px;&quot;
