Most candidates will have achieved grade C or above in English and Maths and a STEM-related subject at Level 2 prior to commencement of apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English and Mathematics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice will have a depth and breadth of english and mathematics that allow them to operate successfully within their role. This may be met through entry criteria determined by the employer or qualifications and training within the apprenticeship. However, on completion all apprentices will have minimum level 2 qualifications in english and mathematics. Some employers may mandate training or qualifications at level 3 in english and/or mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard aligns to the core engineering skills required for similar occupations in other industries. This Standard has been designed to deliver sufficient Underpinning Knowledge and Understanding (UKU) and allow apprentices sufficient experiential, work based learning opportunities to satisfy the requirements for Professional Registration as Engineering Technician (EngTech) as defined by the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Employers will compile an Apprenticeship training plan that describes the training their apprentice will need to meet the standard. It may include a mixture of external and internal training that will ensure the apprentice is fully competent by the end of their programme and ready to take the assessment. It will show when each area of the standard must be acquired and assessed and which areas may be acquired off the job. An apprentice will receive a minimum of 20% of their training away from their day-to-day job. The apprentice will gain transferable core skills and knowledge. In addition they will gain skills specific to the job role and the working practices of their place of employment. The requirements of the apprenticeship are designed to offer stretch and progression.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship standard will be reviewed by employers in September 2017.&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Science manufacturing technicians are found in the process manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship. An apprentice must complete the core and one option relevant to their occupation. The options are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 1. Biotechnology manufacturing technician&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Option 2. Aseptic pharmaceuticals manufacturing technician&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Biotechnology manufacturing technicians produce biological products such as proteins, antibodies, and DNA. These may be used in pharmaceuticals, agricultural products, food and feed, detergents, paper, textiles, and biofuels. The final product may be solid or liquid and may be filled into small volume bottles or large bulk containers. Typically, batch processing is used. They may work in a controlled environment, such as laboratory or clean room, or production facilities. Biotechnology has an important role to play in helping to address many global problems, such as climate change. For example, synthetic biology is already contributing to the development of many biological systems producing drugs, chemicals, and fuels without using fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Aseptic pharmaceuticals manufacturing technicians are involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products - medicines or drugs. They may be involved in part or all of the process including active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) production and final formulation. APIs are the medical ingredient that goes into medicines. Formulations typically involves the blending of the API and other ingredients. Production may be continuous or batch. Technicians work in highly controlled process areas. This could be in large process plant or small rooms depending on the type of medicine being made and the stage of the process. Typically, they will work in a clean room where air particulates are controlled to stop potential contamination of the product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both biotechnology and aseptic pharmaceuticals manufacturing technicians run and maintain the process or processes in line with operational parameters. They conduct quality assurance, resolving or escalating any issues, and complete records. Maintaining workplace safety by following health, safety and environmental risk and management systems is a vital part of the role. They also take part in risk assessment and improvement activities, and support audits.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On a daily basis, they work with other members of the process team. They also have contact with people in other teams for example, laboratory, maintenance, process engineering, supply chain, and warehouse. They may also have contact with external people such as, customers, service providers, and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must ensure that the process and products meet quality specifications and are produced to schedule. They must work to external manufacturing regulations to protect the process, product, plant and equipment, company employees, and the environment. They must also consider sustainability. They may need to wear specialist PPE to protect the product or themselves. This may include, safety glasses, chemical resistant gloves, suits and footwear, and breathing apparatus. They may work alone or part of a team. They work with minimal supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of their work.&lt;/p&gt;",
