  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Chartered Town Planners are professionals who work to achieve sustainable development. &#160;This means they shape the towns, cities or villages we live in by balancing the needs of people and business for homes, jobs, local facilities and open spaces with impacts on the wider environment. Chartered Town Planners therefore deal with official regulations, policy documents and masterplans for changing, improving, reusing or conserving buildings and sites and advise their customers and clients on how best to manage the development and use of land.&#160; Jobs are available in local and national government, private consultancies, corporate firms, voluntary and non-governmental organisations. Chartered Town Planners can work for one of these organisations or themselves across many sectors including construction, environment, housing, energy, transport, regeneration, coastal, heritage and conservation, and minerals and waste.&#160; Typical job titles include Planning Officer, Town Planner, Planner, Development Management Planner and Planning Consultant. Career progression can be to Senior Planner, Principal Planning Officer, or similar and will involve dealing with larger, more complex projects and taking on increasing managerial responsibiliites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must abide by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) Code of Professional Conduct and ethical standards because they hold positions of responsibility and make decisions that impact on the built and natural environment and long term well-being of communities. The occupation is regulated by high standards of professionalism assuring clients and employers of the quality of service they will receive.&#160; Chartered Town Planners are able to direct instructions to Barristers, without their client having to&#160;use a solicitor as an intermediary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main responsibilities of a Chartered Town Planner are to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as ambassadors of town and country and spatial planning and to ensure this is undertaken for the benefit of the public&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Balance the economic growth, social and environmental demands and impacts of communities and landowners on towns, cities and rural areas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prepare and/or determine statutory planning applications, plans or proposals.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Formulate and implement strategic and local planning policy, laws and practice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan for the delivery of infrastructure such as roads, railway stations, minerals and waste and energy facilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Identify and analyse issues, courses of action and projects regarding the planning of land and buildings.
