  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in supervisory and regulatory organisations and authorities across the public sector, who monitor and investigate levels of compliance. This occupation is distinct to the public sector, as only the government can apply civil and criminal penalties, or pursue public prosecutions. Compliance staff need to understand, investigate and negotiate with individuals and organisations who, by accident or with intent, may not be complying with or are deliberately evading regulation or law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to protect the UKâ€™s public interest, money and services, driving improved customer compliance that supports the honest majority who meet their obligations and makes it hard for the dishonest minority, identifying potential acts of criminality and supporting civil or criminal proceedings. This raises standards of compliance across the UK, treating everybody fairly and with respect, applying the law impartially with integrity and honesty. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues, working independently with a team of Compliance officers and investigators, reporting to a senior manager. Employees liaise with other specialists and professions, including policy and legal teams. They will interact with customers that range from individuals to large corporate organisations, identifying and investigating possible or apparent anomalies in documentation or other sources of evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employees may also interact with 3rd party agencies in order to support their work, such as local authorities or law enforcement agencies, as well as representing their organisation at tribunals or in court. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for conducting risk-based compliance checks and investigations by applying appropriate legislation, case law, policy and procedure, so that casework can be carried out with integrity and minimal opportunity for technical error. They will work independently to obtain evidence through various fact-finding methodologies, which may range from reviewing documents to contentious interviews. They will exercise judgement and discretion within specified parameters to test credibility and will make evidence-based decisions and recommendations, including when to escalate an issue, and to whom. Compliance officers and investigators will make recommendations and judgements within defined parameters, obtaining authority to proceed from a Senior Manager for decisions that fall outside those parameters.&lt;/p&gt;",
