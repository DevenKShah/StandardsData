  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations of all sizes (small, medium, large, and global), in public, private, and third sectors. They generally work in the accounts/finance department of an organisation or a professional accountancy firm. The broad purpose of the occupation is to manage and implement accounting, finance systems and processes that support decision-making in-line with strategy by applying technical and technological knowledge and skills to all aspects of accounting and finance within an organisation. This may include: managing operations of the accounting/finance function; supporting senior management/other departments by providing timely financial information and reports; ensuring compliance with: internal controls, HMRC, legislation, regulations, ethical and professional codes; monitoring the efficient, effective, and economical, working of all systems using the most appropriate technology; problem-solving, making recommendations, and giving advice to internal or/and external clients. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders, including directors and senior managers, clients and customers, suppliers, lenders, government agencies, auditors, and other professionals. A typical day could include being in an office environment overseeing data entry, control account reconciliations, budgeting and forecasting, trend analysis, monthly, quarterly, yearly reporting, researching and recommending solutions for decision makers. An Accounting and Finance manager will work both independently as well as working in or leading teams. They play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between strategic and operational levels of an organisation by employing a broad range of knowledge and skills: technical, technological, and interpersonal. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for contributing to and implementing business plans and strategy, as decided upon by senior management, as well as managing the systems and operations used to realise them. This involves: overseeing operations, monitoring, analysing, and controlling systems and procedures, ensuring the efficient, economic, and effective use of resources; managing the budgetary process, analysing variances, researching and explaining change, and making recommendations; the monitoring and controlling of cash flows, spotting trends, and forecasting requirements; and will be involved in training and recruiting staff in line with strategy. They will conduct regular and detailed analysis of data and provide regular financial and management information as required by internal and external stakeholders. &lt;br&gt;In a larger organisation the Accounting and finance manager may report to a finance director (a professional accountant), whereas in a smaller organisation they could be the most senior technical specialist, reporting to a (non-technical) senior manager such as a chief executive. In a professional practice environment, they may report to a senior manager, director or partner.&lt;br&gt;Typically they will be responsible for the accounting and finance function and oversee the operations thereof. This may mean they lead a team of accounts, finance and tax technicians managing day to day operations as required.&lt;/p&gt;",
