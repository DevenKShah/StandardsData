  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the supply chain industry. The cold chain is a series of uninterrupted refrigerated production methods, storage and distribution activities, along with associated equipment and logistics, which maintain quality via a desired temperature range. It is used to preserve, to extend and ensure the shelf life of products such as meat, fresh agricultural produce, seafood, frozen food, chemicals, and pharmaceutical products as well some unusual products such as antiques and artwork. The industry is crucial to the transportation and distribution of vaccines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to install, service and repair transport refrigeration units (TRU) and associated equipment, found on vehicles such as HGV trucks, HGV trailers and home delivery vans. Technicians are highly skilled individuals, able to quickly diagnose faults and maintenance issues encountered with this complex and specialist equipment. The service provided must be of the highest level in order to protect and preserve the various loads the client is responsible for transporting. Professionalism and product knowledge are key skills the technician must possess in order to carry out the work effectively. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with customers, their local service office, client security staff and other drivers. Technicians could be based in a depot or mobile, working from a van travelling to customer sites to carry out service and repairs. They can also be on-call, required to attend urgent breakdown calls to repair a client’s equipment so that they can complete their deliveries. A single loaded trailer can have hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stock and repairs are often required to be carried out urgently to save the load. Because of the nature of the industry, these calls can come in 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for their van, company equipment and stock that they carry. Maintaining stock is paramount and maintaining a complete stock of base level equipment ensures the required parts are instantly available.&lt;/p&gt;",
