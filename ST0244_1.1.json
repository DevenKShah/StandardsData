A Chartered Legal Executive can work in all areas of law.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to handle legal matters including giving legal advice. They will draft legal documents and may act as a Commissioner for Oaths.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending upon which area of law they work in, Chartered Legal Executive lawyers may handle the legal aspects of a property transfer, draft wills, draw up documents to assist in the formation of a company, advise husbands and wives with matrimonial problems or clients accused of serious or petty crime. In the public sector they may work across a range of government departments whether in a local authority or central government.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chartered Legal Executive lawyers are fee earners. In private practice, their work is charged directly to clients making a direct contribution to the income of a law firm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate legal team, legally and non-legally trained stakeholders and customers who use their services. They may also interact with government departments, financial institutions, regulators and professional bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for managing a caseload of legal matters and providing advice to clients.
