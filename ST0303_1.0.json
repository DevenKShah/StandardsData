Plumbing and domestic heating technicians can find themselves working inside or outside a property. Customer service skills and being tidy and respectful are important qualities as they can often find themselves working in customers’ homes as well as on building sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a competent Plumbing and Heating Technician, the installation of plumbing and heating systems includes accurate measuring, marking, cutting, bending and jointing metallic and non-metallic pipework. Appliances and equipment can include gas, oil and solid fuel boilers as well as pumps, heat emitters, bathroom furniture or controls as part of a cold water, hot water, and central heating or above ground drainage and rainwater systems. Plumbing and Domestic Heating Technicians are at the forefront of installing new and exciting environmental technologies like heat pumps, solar thermal systems, biomass boilers and water recycling systems. It is important for a plumbing and heating technician to be able to work independently or as a team and use their knowledge and skills to ensure that both the system and appliances are appropriately selected and correctly installed, often without any supervision, and done so in a safe, efficient and economical manner to minimise waste.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Core Knowledge and Skills Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;133&quot; style=&quot;width: 133px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th width=&quot;406&quot; style=&quot;width: 406px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Health and safety&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand health and safety legislation, codes of practice and safe working practices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Core plumbing systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand selection, planning, installation, testing, commissioning and de-commissioning, service, maintenance, fault diagnosis and repair techniques on cold water, hot water, central heating, above ground drainage and rainwater systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical components and control systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand installation and testing techniques for electrical components and control systems on plumbing and domestic heating systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plumbing science and processes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand scientific plumbing, domestic heating and mechanical principles&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Principles of environmental technology systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of domestic mechanical environmental technology systems&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Principles of fossil fuels&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of fuel combustion, ventilation and fluing arrangements within a domestic environment&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;133&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Customer service&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;406&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understand the principles of high quality customer service and establishing the needs of others (colleagues, customers and other stakeholders).
