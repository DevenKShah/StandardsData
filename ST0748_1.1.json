  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help organisations, businesses, charities, the public sector and social enterprises to find new and innovative approaches to working and build resilience based on economically sound, socially friendly and environmentally driven principles. They will be responsible for developing and collaborating in the development of organisational sustainability strategies. They will implement and monitor sustainability strategies, influencing behaviour of stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, colleagues and consumers. The role is highly challenging and multifaceted and will reach across all areas of the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with numerous colleagues including a specialist subject manager or a senior manager within the organisation at executive or non-executive director level or within smaller organisations they may be at director or board level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation may lead a team or work in a matrix management structure to drive change.&amp;nbsp; They would be required to liaise with external stakeholders on a variety of sustainable issues, for example Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), industry and regulatory bodies. An employee in this occupation will have joint or shared responsibility for implementing a sustainability culture throughout the organisation. This will mean they will need to work across functions throughout the organisation and will have a high level of autonomy to do so. In some organisations, they may lead a small team of dedicated experts, however in other organisations, they will work within a management structure with no line management responsibilities. The level of supervision they receive will be down to the size of the company and the individual structures of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;",
