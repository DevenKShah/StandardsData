  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a level 5 Apprenticeship&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Metrology is the science of measurement and includes all theoretical and practical aspects of measurement. Measurement underpins the UK economy and international trade. Each year in the UK over&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&#163;600 billion worth of goods and utilities are sold based on the measurement of their quantity and quality. Metrology takes place across a wide range of industries as diverse as advanced manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, construction, energy, environment, pharma and healthcare and space and within all sizes of organisation. Important measurement activities can range from measuring galaxies to graphene, molecules, chemical pollutants, hip joints, aircraft, industrial emissions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A competent Senior Metrology Technician will be able to manage resources and measurement activities and will implement processes and techniques that are sustainable, support good practice and comply with relevant standards and principles. They will develop and monitor measurement capability and capacity and will be responsible for the planning, quality, accuracy, timely delivery and evaluation of metrology activities within their area of responsibility. They will be able to apply a measurement strategy and understand its commercial impact. They will analyse, interpret and evaluate information and will be able to use this information to inform future measurement developments. They will participate in and provide advice on activities such as audits and risk assessments. They will also be able to build effective communication channels and relationships with colleagues, customers and stakeholders. Their knowledge of the industry, their own organisation and its customers will enable them to take the lead in finding strategic solutions to measurement problems and identifying areas for improvement. The successful apprentice will become a valuable measurement specialist, within their organisation, significantly contributing to the future of the Metrology industry and the UK economy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Areas may include: &lt;/strong&gt;Senior Metrology Technicians associated with Measurement Research;
