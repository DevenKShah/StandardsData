The required behaviours are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong work ethic: &lt;/strong&gt;motivated, proactive, committed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependability and responsibility: &lt;/strong&gt;punctual, reliable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive attitude: &lt;/strong&gt;constructive thinking; motivated to succeed, committed to diversity and environmental, social &amp;amp; economic sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team player: &lt;/strong&gt;able to work and interact effectively within a team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective communication: &lt;/strong&gt;spoken, listening, body language, presentation, written&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: &lt;/strong&gt;able to adjust to change&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honesty and integrity: &lt;/strong&gt;truthful, sincere&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-motivation: &lt;/strong&gt;self-starter; pro-active approach to tasks, able to make appropriate decisions and lead their own development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal commitment: &lt;/strong&gt;prepared to make a personal commitment to the industry&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;try Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeship. In order to optimise success, candidates will typically possess three GCSEs C grade (or equivalent) or above on entry including Maths and English. Apprentices without Level 2 Maths and English must achieve this prior to taking the end-point assessment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ur&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ation of Apprenticeship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 36 months, timescales may reduce if an apprentice has prior relevant qualifications/experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualifications and Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a period of foundation skills and technical knowledge development all apprentices will be required to achieve the following&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;qualifications (working titles -currently in development)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 2 Aerospace and Aviation (Foundation Competence)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;plus&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 3 Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering Survival Equipment Maintenance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a further period of skills and technical knowledge development all apprentices will be required to achieve the following qualification (working title - currently in development)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Level 3 Aerospace and Aviation (Development Competence)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All of the qualification requirements in the foundation and development phase are mandatory outcomes for the completion and final certification of the Apprenticeship Standard. Each qualification has a core and options approach and employers will select the most applicable pathway and unit options to meet their business requirements. Further detail can be found in the Employer Occupational Brief which is an annex to the Assessment Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be an assessment at the end of the development phase where the apprentice will need to demonstrate full competence against the qualification outcomes for knowledge, skills and behaviours, set out in the Standard and Employer Occupational Brief. On successful completion of the employer endorsement phase (sign off) apprentices will be then be put forward to be awarded their Apprenticeship completion certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reco&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship will be recognised by the Training Requirements Authority (TRA) at the appropriate level of professional competence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level and Review &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This Apprenticeship Standard is at Level 3 (equivalent to two A levels A*- C grade) and will be reviewed after three years to ensure it continues to meet employers’ requirements and provides the basis for progression to higher qualifications and or job roles.&lt;/p&gt;",
