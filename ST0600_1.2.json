  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;A hearing aid dispenser is someone who works independently to test people&#39;s hearing, advise on hearing care and, where necessary, supply and fit hearing aids and other communication devices. Hearing aid dispensers are registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (www.hcpc-uk.org). This role requires strict adherence to professional standards, which includes maintaining accurate records and identifying the need for onward referral for a medical opinion. Hearing aid dispensers can work in employed or self-employed positions in a variety of settings, including the NHS, private practice and retail,. The role is typically performed in either a clinical, community or domiciliary setting. In their daily work, a hearing aid dispenser interacts with the general public through scheduled appointments, other healthcare professionals and colleagues within their organisation. A hearing aid dispenser will generally act alone and is responsible for seeing adults, including vulnerable members of the community, who have various stages of hearing difficulty or ear health issues, providing a range of services designed to support communication and participation in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;",
