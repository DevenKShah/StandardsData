  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Physiotherapy is a science-based profession.&#160; Physiotherapists work with individuals, and their families and carers, from birth to end of life and in a wide range of health and social care settings.&#160; They lead and deliver programmes and interventions to help people affected by injury, ageing, illness or disability. &#160;Physiotherapists use a range of physical and psychological treatment approaches, including movement, exercise and manual therapy, to optimise an individual’s mobility, function and quality of life. They also provide education about health and wellbeing and provide specific advice that can be applied to everyday activities to manage and reduce the risk of pain or injury. &#160;The profession helps to encourage development and facilitate recovery, enabling people to remain independent for as long as possible. As a physiotherapist, you will practise as an autonomous, independent practitioner, while contributing strongly to team-working. Individuals are able to seek care directly from you and without referral from another professional. &#160;You will work with people who may present with complex and challenging problems resulting from multiple illnesses, injury or disability. &#160;In addition to providing physiotherapy interventions, you will play a substantial educational, health coaching and advisory role to patients, other healthcare professionals and the public. &#160;Physiotherapists typically work in a range of large and small organisations across public, private and charitable sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities and duty of the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will use your comprehensive knowledge and clinical reasoning skills to assess, diagnose and treat people with problems caused by illness, injury, disability or ageing.&#160; You will see human movement as central to the health and wellbeing of individuals. &#160;You will treat people with neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, mental health, respiratory conditions and &#160;those requiring palliative care, amongst others. &#160;As well as treating people, you will also promote good health and advise people on how to prevent or reduce the risk of injury and illness. You will be responsible and accountable for your actions, and for reflecting on the effectiveness of these, with the aim of continually improving patient experience. &#160;You will also be responsible for ensuring your own knowledge and skills remain current, including through ensuring that your practice is evidence-based and that you maintain your professional competence. &#160;You will also play a role in supporting others’ learning, including future entrants to the profession. &#160;You will demonstrate leadership qualities and manage and lead colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will be required to complete a BSc (Hons) degree in Physiotherapy or Level 7 qualification approved &#160;by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and accredited by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy where the apprentice already holds a Level 6 degree. &lt;strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completing the end-point assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 3 A levels to include biology or human biology, or, an equivalent access qualification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional registration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On successful completion of an approved programme, you will be eligible to apply to the HCPC for registration to practise as a physiotherapist in the UK. &#160;You will also be eligible to apply for full membership and chartered status with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;6&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &lt;/strong&gt;Typically 4 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date: &lt;/strong&gt;After 3 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be able to:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will know and understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physiotherapy practice

well-being.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design and deliver individual and group rehabilitation activities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Manage a clinical caseload to meet identified needs and contribute to &#160;efficient service delivery individually or as part of a team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Promote health and well-being, advising on reducing the risk or effects of illness and supporting individuals to achieve reasonable, person specific goals e.g. walking following a stroke, self-management of a long-term breathing problem, reducing the risk of falls.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Include health technologies in how you deliver advice and interventions, in line with individual needs and available/accessible resources e.g. exercise apps.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep accurate, timely records of the care that you deliver.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comply with all relevant health and safety requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a range of communication approaches, in line with people’s needs, to provide information, advice and solutions to patients, carers, health care professionals and those to whom you delegate activity.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use contemporary quality evidence to inform your practice.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effectively evaluate professional practice to inform personal and service development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Raise and act on concerns about issues that may compromise safety, quality and risk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The
