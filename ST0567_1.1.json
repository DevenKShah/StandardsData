  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This occupation is found in&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;healthcare. Paramedics carry out their work in a wide variety of settings, which may include a front-line ambulance, GP surgery, a minor injury/illness centre, in remote medicine or a varied range of other community environments including patients’ homes. On successful completion of this apprenticeship standard, including the approved qualification, apprentices would be eligible to apply to the Health and Care Professions Council to register as a Paramedic, which is a protected title. Paramedics work shifts and are required to work in traumatic and stressful situations; the role can be physically and mentally demanding and is often outside in all environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to&lt;/strong&gt;&#160;respond to 999 critical emergencies and traumatic situations to deliver high quality and effective pre-hospital clinical care and patient transportation in a safe and timely manner. Paramedics are usually the first to arrive at the scene of an accident or emergency before any other healthcare professional and are required to quickly carry out a risk assessment of the scene then decide on how to best treat the patient. This decision usually includes a diagnostic evaluation of the patient’s condition and may include administration of medication before they get to the hospital. Paramedics may also transport patients that are being transferred between hospitals or services. Paramedics use advanced driving skills under emergency and non-emergency driving conditions to respond to and transport emergency and routine calls as required. Paramedics are autonomous practitioners and must meet the ‘Standards of Proficiency – Paramedics’ and the ‘Standards of conduct, performance and ethics’ set by the HCPC. They also act in accordance with the organisation’s policies, procedures and protocols and always adhere to guidelines and current legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;a wide range of healthcare professionals such as medical and nursing staff as well as with patients, carers, relatives, and members of the public. They will also work alongside other emergency services like the police and fire and rescue services. A paramedic may work alone or as part of a crew with other paramedics, ambulance technicians and ambulance support workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for&#160;&lt;/strong&gt;initiating care and effective treatment to patients in both hospital and pre-hospital environment. Paramedics select and apply skills and equipment safely and within their level of training, competency and scope of practice. A paramedic is responsible for making clinical decisions and, if appropriate, providing advice to patients, clinicians and other healthcare professionals. Paramedics use high-tech equipment when attending to emergency situations eg defibrillators and are required to maintain the vehicle and equipment and ensure efficient use of medical supplies. A paramedic can administer medicines, intravenous fluids and oxygen. They normally act independently within the bounds of their knowledge and scope of practice, reporting to a more senior colleague as required. They will mentor other staff and may be required to provide supervision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
