  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Metal Casting, Foundry and Patternmaking Technicians are involved in highly skilled, complex and important roles in the Cast Metals Industry.&#160; The UK industry is a modern and advanced sector, producing 530,000 tonnes of castings in all metals with an annual value of &#163;2.2 Billion and the 400 foundries employ more than 17,000 Operatives, Technicians, Engineers, Supervisors, Managers and Staff.&#160; Castings may weigh less than a gramme or over 600 tonnes. The industry underpins and is a vital supplier to other industries (automotive, aerospace, rail, power and renewable energy, medical, pumps &amp;amp; valves, defence, petrochemical and marine).&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians can be employed in all sizes of companies, working independently or as part of a team in a foundry, workshop or laboratory.&#160; An eye for detail is necessary and they will need to comply with safety requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Common Technician job titles are: Pattern and Model Making or Methods Development Technician who plan how to design and make patterns in wood, resin or metal from 2D/3D drawings, sometimes using additive manufacturing techniques and simulation software programmes, to produce prototypes or sample castings to tight tolerance; Foundry Material and Process Control Technician, Foundry Production or Metal Casting Furnace and Ladle Technician who prepare and control sand or liquid metal quality for casting into moulds or dies, which may involve maintenance and control of complex automated equipment; Post Casting Technician; Inspection, Non-Destructive, Mechanical Testing and Quality Assurance Technician who inspect and carry out and record control tests on samples or castings to meet agreed tolerances. To be occupationally competent, the core knowledge, skills and behaviours listed below must be achieved, plus knowledge and skills from one of the specialist options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE KNOWLEDGE&lt;/strong&gt;: needs to understand:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant statutory, quality, environmental compliance procedures and systems, organisational and health and safety regulations relating to manufacturing operations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their individual roles and responsibilities within the organisation and the limits of their own authority and the implications of operating outside of this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to interpret relevant engineering and manufacturing data and documentation to execute their job role, i.e., how to understand a 2-dimensional engineering drawing and use this to produce a 3-dimensional model.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The general Metal Casting, Foundry and Patternmaking manufacturing mathematical and scientific principles, methods, techniques, graphical expressions, symbols formulae and calculations used by this engineering environment. i.e. how to understand contraction allowances in the calculation of technical drawings for specific pattern production or the temperature specifications of casting liquid metal.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The structure, properties and characteristics of common materials used in the sector for example: Pattern Making materials like different woods, metals and plastics, Foundry Sand, Binders, Coatings, Feeding and Filtration Systems, Refractories, Various Metal Alloys, Additives, Waxes and Lubricants. Laboratory Testing including: Sand and Binder Properties, Chemical Composition and Mechanical Testing i.e.: Tensile and Hardness Testing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The full process of producing castings from a technical drawing to a finished casting and they must have knowledge of the manufacturing practices, processes and procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE SKILLS:&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be able to:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply safe systems of work, complying with health and safety legislation, regulations, environmental compliance procedures and systems and other relevant guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate clear and effective communication skills which include oral, written, electronic and visual displays.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and obtain all the resources and documentation required to undertake the manufacturing process i.e. a technician would plan and prepare the process to produce prototype castings. All elements and steps would be required to be planned, resources would need to be briefed and all stages of production recorded.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake the work using the correct processes, procedures and equipment. i.e. the final inspection of a complete casting prior to despatch to ensure it complies with customer specifications.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perform safety, quality and compliance checks, using the correct processes, procedures and equipment. i.e.: ensuring the gravity die assembly is safe and ready to start production.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete appropriate documentation in an accurate, efficient and legible way by using the correct terminology.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain a positive working relationship with a range of people working within the manufacturing environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deal promptly and effectively with Casting, Foundry or Patternmaking problems within the limits of their responsibility using approved diagnostic methods and techniques and report those which cannot be resolved.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work efficiently and effectively, maintaining workplace organisation and minimising waste.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE BEHAVIOURS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Metal Casting, Foundry and Patternmaking industry, require their apprentices to have a set of behaviours that is in line with the Engineering Council’s guidelines to ensure success in both their role and in the overall company objectives.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal responsibility and resilience&lt;/strong&gt; – Comply with the health and safety guidance and procedures, be disciplined and have a responsible approach to risk.
