  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in theatres, live events, film and TV and commercial workshops who undertake work for these organisations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Construction Technicians, depending on employer requirements and contracts, also undertake work in conference venues, theme parks, shop/restaurant displays, themed installations, festivals, corporate events and exhibitions. The broad purpose of the occupation is to safely design and construct bespoke scenic elements for example simple walled structures (flats), platforms, doors, stairs, windows and floors using a variety of techniques including using carpentry skills, metal fabrication skills and draughting skills. Scenic Construction Technicians follow the design specification of the designer and work within the parameters that various environments dictate for example working at height or within confined spaces. They may make their own basic technical drawings or use more complex ones provided by others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Construction Technicians pre-fit large assemblies of smaller components and break them down for transportation/storage or delivery to the client, checking materials for defects at all times. They may also be part of a construction team that fits up the scenic elements onstage/onsite, working closely with other departments such as the stage crews, rigging and automation department, lighting and sound departments. They undertake repairs and maintenance to the sets during the set lifetime as well as store, repair and maintain tools and equipment which they use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are required to communicate with other stakeholders about the design. As required they will discuss the design specification, typically with the designer, offering alternative suggestions on materials, for example. They work efficiently and effectively to minimise the environmental impact of their work whilst maximising sustainability. This can be done by controlling personal material use and minimising waste.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with fellow team members such as carpenters, lead carpenter, metal fabricators, draughts people, the construction manager and their supervisor who may check process and provide guidance. They may also interact with designers in connection with the interpretation of their vision,&amp;nbsp; to make sure it is being interpreted accurately. They may interact with the client whilst they check progress but this occurs less frequently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the scenic element is constructed, they interact with scenic artists, production managers, stage supervisors, crew, directors, lighting designers, sound designers, video designers, choreographers, illusionists and prop makers to ensure that the scenic elements can be installed and finished as required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for achieving the designer’s vision for the scenic elements by interpreting and working from more complex construction drawings, models and references created by others. Working to agreed specifications, they produce scenic elements, which may be bespoke,&amp;nbsp; creating their own basic construction drawings for example 2D, for basic wooden or metal frames. Prior to construction, they check materials for defects, informing others if appropriate, in accordance with procedure requirements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scenic Construction Technicians will work with others to achieve the objectives of the project, including timescales and the interpretation of the designer’s vision. They must adhere to health, safety, environmental and sustainability policies, procedures and regulations including the safe use, required maintenance and safe storage of tools and equipment in accordance with local and manufacturer’s requirements. They will effectively control personal material use, taking into account material sustainability and environmental impact to minimise waste and increase efficiency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will adapt their approach as the situation, circumstances and/or people change whilst achieving personal objectives set by their manager They are trusted to work unsupervised under the brief of their supervisor. They will be required to work during evenings and weekends during &#39;fit up&#39; and production periods.&lt;/p&gt;",
