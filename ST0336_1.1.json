  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in small specialist firms to large multi-national and multi-disciplinary consultancies and contractors, to local authorities, Government departments and agencies. Transport planning technicians may be found in academia, research organisations, in providers of infrastructure and transport, and with developers and financing companies with transport interests &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide technical support in the planning, design, implementation or assessment of transport planning policies, plans and projects. Transport planning technicians will use their broad knowledge and skills base to support the delivery of, or improvement to, local, regional, national or international transport systems or services that are appropriately risk assessed and sustainable. They will also use data analysis and digital technologies to model and forecast the demand for transport or travel, enabling technicians to identify how they may influence choice, or assess and appraise various modes of transport or travel. Transport planning technicians connect transport with land use planning to support economic growth, protect the environment and support social cohesion through consideration of security, safety and inclusion &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their own team, each contributing to the delivery of transport projects, processes and/or policies. Transport planning technicians may communicate and work with other professionals across their organisation, including those involved in planning, environmental assessment, engineering and construction, but they could also liaise with a wide range of stakeholders including the general public and regulatory bodies. The majority of their time will be spent working in an office environment, with the potential for occasional work visiting sites, clients, customers or suppliers &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for initiating and completing assigned transport planning tasks to defined specifications within agreed timescales and budget, following best practice and policy and regulatory requirements, whilst maintaining high levels of professional conduct, ethical behaviour and integrity. Transport planning technicians will typically be working with a more senior transport planning professional, providing technical input on transport planning projects which can be challenging, complex and non-routine&lt;/p&gt;",
