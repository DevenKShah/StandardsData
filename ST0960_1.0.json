  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in and throughout the construction and built environment sector, including construction contracting and associated supply chain subcontractors. Construction Contracting Operations Technicians operate in a range of settings including estimating, planning, buying, site, quantity surveying and design and build roles. Site and office environments include industrial, commercial, residential, refurbishment, heritage, retail and public sector projects. They may be employed by large contracting organisations such as major national housebuilding contractors and civil engineering contractors, as well as a significant number of small and medium sized contractors and subcontractors such as building services companies, insulation contractors, groundworkers, roofing companies, plasterers and decorators together with a host of other specialised construction areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is working in an exciting and dynamic environment which could be in an office or on a construction site at the heart of the contracting organisations including versatile activities using digital processes and systems to secure future projects and to enable progress and completion of actual construction sites. Technicians within this specific career area are engaged to interpret, analyse, contribute and directly assist construction contracting professionals working with a wide range of project resources and documentation regularly interacting with internal and external customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians will also develop a range of highly transferable knowledge, skills and behaviours that can be applied across a range of large and small construction companies and in associated contracting job roles including public and private sector work. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with professional and technical teams across different parts of the organisation, potentially on a range of sites or in an office environment. They will liaise with external organisations either through site or office communications due to the need to ensure built environment activities and services are progressed at the right time, to high quality standards, with accurate designs and at competitive rates. Interaction also includes working with other construction contracting operations technicians in areas that include estimating, planning, buying, site, quantity surveying and design and build because their respective processes interact with each other during the whole life cycle of a construction project.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for supporting construction contracting teams with the inputting and progression of digital project information linked to resources using industry standard and specialist software in office and site environments. They will develop key information and enhance timely interaction with professional site and technical teams from internal and external organisations, linked to projects either at development, construction or maintenance phases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Effectively recognising site hazards and safe working practices with thorough knowledge of relevant health, safety and environmental legislation to ensure compliance with company site procedures and processes. They will be able to analyse, extract and produce a variety of contract and project documents that will enable the effective operation and progression of construction contracting activities. They will ensure timely communication linked to the progress and completion of all tasks that they are set with a clear mandate to identify any issues as and when they arise; wherever possible resolving those issues using their own initiative.&lt;/p&gt;",
