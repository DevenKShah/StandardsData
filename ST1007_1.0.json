  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the Aviation sector, across a range of different types of organisations and employers such as those working to support both civilian and military aviation at locations that support flight operations. This occupation is found in diverse settings including general aviation (private and recreational), commercial aviation and military aviation. Consequently, those working in this occupation support a wide range of different aircraft and flight objectives. This in turn impacts the support needs of the flight. Aviation flight operations coordinator typically work in highly organised teams in a number of environments, on or off site, which could include commercial airports, military bases or aerodromes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide the aircraft with the technical support required both prior to and during the flight. They do this by coordinating all aircraft technical and operational factors that are needed for a successful flight. They achieve this by assessing planned flights and a wide range of associated factors including the weather, overflight permits, route planning, aircraft performance, airport facilities, the recording of the aircraft’s technical condition and fuel requirements. They take decisions that address these needs, putting in place the physical requirements (such as aviation systems and equipment), that ensure the aircraft is ready for flight. Once the aircraft is airborne, the aviation flight operation coordinator monitors progress, providing information needed to maintain the flight. Working with a range of internal and external stakeholders and agencies, Flight operation coordinators provide an efficient and effective service that meets customer needs and maintains operational and regulatory standards. This is very responsible work as it impacts the safety of the aircraft and all those on board or on the ground. It also can have a significant financial or operational impact on the organisation. Aviation flight operation coordinators therefore play a key role in delivering successful aviation operations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate team and other aviation stakeholders critical to the safe and effective planning, delivery and recovery of aviation assets. The stakeholders they interact with includes, for instance, aviation engineers, airfields, and parts suppliers. They often work alongside support schedulers, who arrange the crew rosters. This work all needs careful coordination to ensure safe and successful flights. They also liaise during a flight, for example with air traffic control and with the aircraft itself, providing them with information that impacts their route. Aviation flight operation coordinators typically coordinate several flights at the same time. Working shifts can vary; typically a Flight Operations Coordinator will work shift patterns covering the 24-hour operation. Their work and that of the wider team is typically overseen by a line manager who could be a technical expert (aviation operations manager, chief pilot, pilot manager). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for contributing to the decision-making process for the initiation, continuation, diversion or termination of a flight in the interest of the safety of the aircraft, and the regulatory and efficiency of the flight. They do this by assessing the individual needs of each flight, which could include the equipment, permits, fuel and other practical assistance needed before the aircraft can depart. They are responsible for all aircraft under their own jurisdiction at any given time, and for providing the safe, secure and timely delivery of tasks required for each aircraft. They ensure that the people working in/on the aircraft are supported by coordinating the sequence of events needed. They take decisions that ensure a safe and compliant flight, balancing the need to also optimise business objectives as guided by their aviation operations manager. These decisions affecting a flight are often needed at a very tight timescale either to meet routine timetabling requirements, or in the event of an unexpected incident, such as a disruption or a mechanical failure. Typically, a Flight operation coordinator monitors, assesses and facilitates the safe and effective movement of aircraft and customers, including in-flight monitoring and planning, monitoring weather conditions and disseminating meteorological information to relevant people. Other responsibilities include maintaining good working practices that comply with aviation regulations and health and safety. They must also coordinate wide ranging technical data. Effective communication and teamwork ensure that all aspects of a flight operations coordinator’s role play a critical part in achieving the objectives of their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;",
