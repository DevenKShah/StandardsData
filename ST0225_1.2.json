  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Horticulture or landscape operatives can be employed to work in public parks and gardens, green spaces and historic gardens, private gardens and estates or in production nurseries and retail outlets. Many businesses will be specialised in their activities, such as grounds maintenance (soft-landscape) or landscape construction (hard-landscape). Soft- landscaping includes the establishment and maintenance of plants and cultivated areas. Hard-landscaping includes establishment of hard surfaces and structures in addition to the establishment of plants in cultivated areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The distinct nature of these two specialisms means very few businesses can offer the full breadth of skills and therefore two options are available for this occupation; horticulture and landscape construction. The employment area will dictate the option pursued. The horticulture option focuses on plant propagation and plant growth. The landscape construction option focuses on the installation of features and structures; application of landscape materials as well as supporting site management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Work is generally based outside and undertaken throughout the year, so apprentices will frequently work outside in all weathers. Often people new to the industry will start in a ‘hands-on’ role covering a range of practical tasks, with specialist skills being learnt through progression. A wide range of machinery and tools are used and additional training may be required depending on the nature of the works undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working and learning in the horticulture and landscape industries is rewarding, offers a diverse range of employment opportunities and includes a range of skills that are transferrable into many other industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Required skills, knowledge and behaviours to complete this apprenticeship&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Core knowledge - have an understanding of:&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Industry understanding; the importance and benefits of green-space and the types of horticultural skills appropriate to different businesses and cultural sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Business; business policies, vision and values.

However it came to light that this was unclear and some apprentices have undertaken non Ofqual regulated Emergency First Aid at Work qualifications which comply with Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1998. In order that apprentices are not disadvantaged who hold these qualifications, the employers have agreed that they can enter end-point assessment (providing all other requirements have been met) up until Tuesday 30th June 2020. As from Wednesday 1st July 2020, all apprentices entering EPA, must have completed an Ofqual regulated, Level 3 Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) one day course.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Apprenticeship level&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship standard is at level 2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Review date&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3 years from Implementation&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in a wide range of outdoor spaces with horticultural spaces including public parks and gardens, green spaces, schools, tourist attractions, business and retail parks, historic gardens, private gardens, and estates. Some organisations own the horticultural space such as public gardens and private estates. Some will work on a variety of spaces belonging to other people such as domestic gardens, construction sites, retail and business parks. Employers may be charities, commercial businesses or governmental organisations and range in size from micro businesses through to large employers. Many organisations will be specialised in their activities, such as grounds maintenance or landscape construction. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to undertake practical operations required to create and maintain horticultural spaces. This includes both the soft aspects (plants and soil) and the hard elements (surfaces, features and structures). Some will carry out the full range of operations from landscape construction through to maintenance, although the majority will focus on one specialism due to the breadth of skills required.&amp;nbsp;Horticultural specialists maintain soft and hard elements of the space. This will include planting and maintenance activities. Landscape construction specialists will install landscapes including building hard surfaces, structures and features and planting. &amp;nbsp;This will include planting and maintenance activities. Horticulture or landscape construction operatives frequently work outdoors year-round and in all weathers. They sometimes work at heights for example pruning taller plants and hedges. Horticulture or landscape operatives will require qualifications and or training to undertake activities such as use of machinery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with supervisors and colleagues. Depending upon the employer they will interact with clients, members of the public, other trades and landowners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for completing their own work to specification, with minimal supervision, ensuring they meet set deadlines. They are responsible for meeting quality requirements and working in accordance with legislation, environmental, health, safety and welfare considerations. They are accountable for the health and safety of themselves and others. Horticulture or landscape operatives are responsible for checking their tools, equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) are maintained and safe to use. They report to supervisors, team leaders, head gardeners or clients.&lt;/p&gt;",

Workers are often in isolated locations working in pairs or small teams and it can take some time for them to get help if an accident occurs. Responsible employers to meet the requirements of the law will make sure that a high proportion of their employees are first aid trained and to a sufficient level to deal with accidents that might occur. An Ofqual regulated qualification in first aid provides the assurance that the apprentice will have achieved the required standard to be safe working in the industry.",
