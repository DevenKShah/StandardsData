  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in Dentistry, typically in a dental laboratory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to design, manufacture, modify and repair custom-made dental appliances. Typically the work is undertaken in a dental laboratory on a prescription from a dentist. The work can broadly be split into crown and bridge, dentures and orthodontics. Most labs specialise in one or two of these areas but during the apprenticeship dental technicians will develop competency across all disciplines from start to finish before choosing where to specialise once they are qualified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with the dental team. Dental technicians will need to comply with professional regulation, collaborate with dental practices and occasionally meet patients. Dental technicians will be able to work with minimum supervision and are responsible for the quality of their finished work before it is released to the dentist and patient.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for manufacturing precise custom-made medical appliances but require the attention to detail, colour and manual dexterity that is expected of fine artists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dental technicians are registered professionals and work within the standards and scope of practice as defined by the General Dental Council (GDC) Scope of Practice document.&lt;/p&gt;",
