  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations that sit within the public, private or third sectors. Corporate Responsibility &amp;amp; Sustainability (CR&amp;amp;S) Practitioners are found in all industries and are increasingly a key component of virtually all types of business models where profit and growth are a means to an even greater end, such as protecting the environment and improving societal sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to be a social conscience for the organisation, helping innovate and drive ambitions for social and environmental change and make these a reality that are embedded and implemented across the organisation. The roles and responsibilities of businesses are changing rapidly; society increasingly expects that organisations should act responsibly not just to their shareholders but also to their wider stakeholders and the broader community. Business therefore is a great platform for social and environmental change and CR&amp;amp;S Practitioners help to drive this by delivering an organisation’s CR&amp;amp;S strategy (&quot;The Strategy&quot;), releasing the power of business to contribute positively towards social and environmental outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a variety of internal and external stakeholders. Internally, CR&amp;amp;S practitioners interact with a wide range of staff which could be across one or multiple sites/countries. They facilitate change by helping others to understand how different roles fit within the strategy and how everyone’s contribution can impact the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Practitioners may also reach out into the community in order to work collaboratively, and in some cases to understand the views of external organisations such as charities, social enterprises, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), or local and central government. Furthermore, CR&amp;amp;S Practitioners are often ambassadors for their organisations, championing their CR&amp;amp;S strategy and expanding their network of influence in order to bring about positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for contributing towards, and in some cases ownership of CR&amp;amp;S, campaigns, projects and events, making sure these are embedded by facilitating delivery. Depending on the size of the organisation, the CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner may be expected to contribute towards strategy design, internal and external communications and reporting, data management, research and horizon-scanning, and supporting budget management. Ultimately, they will be responsible for helping to ensure their organisation acts to embed The Strategy into every-day business practices and in turn managing risk and reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not a routine office job; the CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner will typically be working on multiple initiatives covering a variety of geographies, focus areas, and stakeholders. For instance, some roles may be weighted towards managing employee volunteering initiatives or fundraising for charities. Others may have a stronger focus on topics like human rights, carbon reduction, waste management, energy efficiency and supply chain. The occupation can also encompass diversity, inclusion, health &amp;amp; safety, and well-being. Therefore, the CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner’s day-to-day responsibilities will vary depending on circumstances and in turn means they could work independently, in a team, or collaboratively with multiple stakeholders. While not the norm, this may mean occasionally working weekends or evenings to ensure delivery of CR&amp;amp;S initiatives and events. The CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner is also expected to be adaptable, able to thrive in a changeable environment, and support others through the process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is vital for a CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner to be passionate about social and environmental change, and strive to role model ethical behaviour and values. It is also imperative for the CR&amp;amp;S Practitioner to understand their business, the landscape and industry it operates in, and demonstrate the value of CR&amp;amp;S to the business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They work typically as part of a team in medium to larger organisations and report into a senior leader who may be a CR&amp;amp;S specialist. Alternatively, they may report to a different department, for example Human Resources, Communications, or Marketing. It is typical for CR&amp;amp;S Practitioners to put together a business case, to seek permissions and consensus from senior leaders before initiating a project.&lt;/p&gt;",
