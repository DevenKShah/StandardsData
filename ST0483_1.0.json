  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupation&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An “Emergency Service or NHS Integrated Urgent Care Contact Handler” responds to requests for specialist professional assistance from members of the public, colleagues, and employees from other organisations (all of these individuals are called “service users”). The requests from service users could be received through a variety of communication methods, including the telephone (for example, 999 emergency or 111 urgent care calls), online applications, text messages and through social media. Some service users will be directly or indirectly involved in difficult and / or traumatic situations (for example, they may be in danger or unwell), and may display a variety of characteristics (for example, vulnerability, anxiety, confrontational).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of the Contact Handler is to communicate with the service users to ascertain their needs, provide reassurance and advice, and decide and take the appropriate course of action (following processes and procedures). As this action may require an immediate response by emergency service personnel, the Contact Handler has to act calmly and efficiently under pressure, ensuring computer systems are accurately updated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Contact Handler will normally work for a “blue light” organisation, for example, a Police, Fire or Ambulance Service or an NHS Integrated Urgent Care organisation. A Contact Handler will typically work shifts, which will include working some nights, weekends and bank holidays to provide a 24 hour service, 365 days a year. They will not generally have any formal line management responsibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the nature of this role, a minimum age of 18 may be an employer requirement. The ability to converse clearly with service users is essential for this occupation, and in line with the “Code of Practice on the English Language requirements for public sector workers”, qualifications in English may be required by employers (for example, an organisation may require an English GCSE at grades A-C or equivalent). Any other entry requirements will be specified by an employer in the job advertisement and/or job description for the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to comply with the Data Protection legislation, regulations and policies relevant to the specific emergency service sector1 and/or organisations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health, Safety &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to comply with the Health and Safety legislation and any regulations/organisational policies relevant to the specific emergency service sector, including to the management of own welfare.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This will include knowing and understanding how to provide critical health and safety advice to service users, specific to each sector.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Examples of health and safety advice: life saving instructions, how to stay safe in a situation where there is risk of harm to the service user or others, how to respond to a particular type of fire or flooding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equality &amp;amp; Inclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Equality legislation/regulations/policies and how these impact on the way a Contact Handler responds to service users and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced and effective communication techniques, including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ways to build rapport and empathise, reassuring service users whilst they are in an emergency situation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;methods of questioning and listening&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;methods to influence and negotiate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to manage challenging calls and situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Knowledge of Incidents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Incidents relevant to the specific sector, including a full comprehension of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;complex terminology, for example medical conditions, fire-fighting procedures&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;identification of the type and potential consequences of each type of incident, for example, whether an incident is a police or civil matter&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;critical advice/instructions which should be provided to service users in response to specific incidents.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Examples of the types of advice and information provided (which will be dependent on the specific sector): Health and safety instructions/advice (in relation to the situation reported); crime scene preservation; actions to take following a road traffic collision; responding to domestic abuse incidents; CPR guidance to a range of ages; airways management for unconscious patients; childbirth delivery instructions; fire survival guidance for people trapped in a fire; information and advice for chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear incidents; safety advice for people trapped in cars/shut in lifts/immersed in water and for keeping safe in flooded property&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Decision making techniques, including principles of dynamic risk assessment and how to make decisions in critical situations, in line with specific emergency service sector and/or organisational requirements.
