IA helps an organisation accomplish its objectives by bringing a disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes.

IA is the last line of defense in an organisation and must remain impartial and independent in how it works alongside the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;IAProfs are recognised as experts in risk management, internal audit, governance and control. IAProfs are highly competent professional internal auditors, capable of making a significant contribution to the success and strategic direction of an organisation through being an independent voice to leadership. The IAProf will act autonomously, providing challenging and sometimes provocative insights into risks and internal controls. They act in an independent and objective position at all times, representing the interests of the organisation’s stakeholders and must maintain the highest standards of professional conduct and competency; upholding ethical behaviour and integrity at all times. The IAProf is typically part of an audit team, potentially managing other IAProfs or Internal Audit Practitioners (IAPracs).
