  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Arts Therapists work in a range of settings such as the NHS, local authorities, voluntary, or private sector, hospitals, clinics, education, shelters, hospices, or prisons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The occupation’s broad purpose is to use art, drama or music to therapeutically improve service users’ mental and physical health and wellbeing. Arts therapists are both artists in their chosen field and psychological therapists. They use art, drama or music as their primary mode of communication. Arts therapies can help to enhance general development, autonomy, social interaction and communication skills, and can support both mental and physical rehabilitation. They may be used to address anxiety, confusion, pain, trauma and depression and to improve quality of life. Arts therapists help the individual to express feelings about themselves and others in different ways through arts therapy interventions. This is particularly helpful when emotions are too confusing to express verbally, when verbal communication is difficult, or when words are not enough to relay feelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an arts therapist interacts with a wide range of service users, of all ages, who may have a variety of difficulties, disabilities or diagnoses, such as emotional, social, behavioural or mental health problems, learning or physical disabilities, injuries, life-limiting conditions, neurological conditions or physical illnesses. Arts therapy sessions may be delivered individually or in groups, depending on service users’ needs. Arts therapists work closely with their team to provide and receive ongoing managerial, clinical and professional supervision and support. They engage in service development audit, outcome measurement and research. They also work with a range of wider stakeholders or organisations who may be involved in their service user&#39;s care or support, such as family, carers, education providers, or health and social care services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An arts therapist in this occupation is responsible for managing a caseload of individuals with an array of problems, using person-centred approaches to assess a service user’s needs. They work collaboratively with service users to devise therapeutic plans that consider the individual’s complex psychological, emotional, cognitive, physical, communicative and social needs. They build a rapport with service users and create a safe environment to help them to develop their self-awareness and self-confidence, to improve their functioning and to support their mental well-being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
