  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Formwork is internationally recognised as an innovative technique that is used to form concrete structures across the entire infrastructure, from constructing roads, rail, bridges, underground structures to high-rise concrete buildings.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Concrete technology has developed significantly over the past 50 years and continues to do so, with structures being formed stronger, vaster and spanning wider. This has only been achieved by the continued application of new formwork techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Formworkers contribute to the construction of projects through the preparation, installation and quality management of all stages of the formwork and falsework process. Preparing falsework that provides temporary support structures for forms and undertake formwork. This includes producing panels and fittings that mould to form a desired shape with concrete, such as slabs, support beams, columns and walls.. They are involved in the entire envelope of the construction industry: including all the major over ground and underground projects across the UK such as Thameslink, Tideway, HS2, Battersea Power Station, Manchester Tram System, A14, Glasgow School of Art and Hinkley Point. The skills gained can be used world-wide and can also be a stepping stone to for your career i.e. supervisory and management roles.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Requirements: Knowledge, Skills and Behaviour (KSBs)&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;A competent Formworker, on completion of the Apprenticeship Standard, will meet the following requirements, some of which are transferable across Construction Sector:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding of&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Health, Safety and Environment&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The principles of health, safety and welfare and how it must be applied in relation to work and others and their responsibilities under current legislation, (including the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974; Provision and Use of Workplace Equipment 1998; Manual Handling Operation Regulations 1992) and official guidance to when carrying out formwork activities, including safe erection, use and dismantling of falsework&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The different and safe techniques required to move, handle and store resources and how risk assessments, methods statements and manufacturers’ guidance relate to their activities&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Communication&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;How to communicate with others and follow organisational procedures to conform to productive work practices&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Affects that poor communication could have on the overall process and how the use of communication correctly would improve teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;87&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Planning, preparing and organising work&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The material application relevant in accordance with the contract specification and planning the sequence of works involved with other construction trades.
