  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the health sector. Dietitians are predominantly employed by the NHS, working in hospitals, seeing patients both on wards and in out-patient clinics, and in the community, for example, seeing patients in GP practices, their own home, care homes, schools or health centres. Dietitians are also employed in the food industry, including clinical nutrition companies, with further employment opportunities in higher education, sport, media, and national and local government. Some dietitians are freelance and self-employed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The occupation’s broad purpose is to assess, diagnose, plan, implement, monitor, review and evaluate nutrition and dietetic interventions. Dietitians use the most up-to-date public health and scientific research on food, health and disease to inform their practice. They work in partnership with a diverse range of people to provide tailored, evidence-based practical advice to individuals, groups and populations across the lifespan. Dietitians are key members of clinical multi-disciplinary teams. They prevent, manage and treat a wide range of conditions including diabetes, obesity, heart disease, food allergy and intolerance, gastrointestinal disorders, cancer, stroke, liver and kidney disease, mental health conditions, and disease-related malnutrition. Dietitians use advanced communication and behaviour-change skills to enable individuals to make lifestyle and food choices to improve their health and wellbeing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dietitians also tailor specific nutritional, diet-related advice, using a range of tools to work with a diverse set of individuals, groups, communities and other health professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They may supervise dietetic assistants/support workers and contribute to training dietetic students in the department. They will typically be managed by a dietitian service manager. Although they work as part of a wider healthcare team, dietitians often work remotely from the team as autonomous practitioners, which means that they are &lt;a&gt;professionally and legally&lt;/a&gt; accountable for their own actions and decisions. They are responsible for maintaining their own knowledge and skills and must engage in continuing professional development activities to maintain their statutory registration.&lt;/p&gt;",
