They &lt;/span&gt;currently work in over 40 specialties across GP practices, hospitals and community care, with roles determined by local need and decisions. The largest proportion of Physician associates work with doctors and other colleagues in primary care, followed by emergency and acute medicine. Other specialties include geriatrics, stroke, community and dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; line-height: 21pt; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=&quot;margin: 0; line-height: 21pt; background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); vertical-align: baseline&quot;&gt;Physician associates are generalist healthcare professionals who work alongside doctors and provide medical care as part of the multidisciplinary team. They always work under the supervision and ultimately direction of a named senior doctor. A Physician associate delivers aspects of patient care through defined tasks and procedures.
