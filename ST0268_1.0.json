The work includes supporting piling plant machine operatives and specialist piling operatives (Level 3) by performing a variety of manual and mechanically assisted tasks which will include; load and unload, handle and move materials, prepare, measure, mark and cut materials, monitoring and reporting progress. Guide and control the movement and operation of plant, machinery and vehicles. Prepare, check, control and maintain machinery and equipment in use.

This creates a continuous pile without ever leaving an open hole.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rotary Large Diameter: uses a bored piling machine with specially designed drilling tools, buckets and grabs to remove soil and rock. The auger with 4 or 5 turns of flight is bored into the ground, withdrawn, and the spoil removed. This process is repeated until the design depth is reached. Reinforcement is then positioned and concrete placed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Driven – Pre-cast: metal or pre-cast concrete piles are usually top-driven using hydraulic drop hammers, some of which are super-silenced. Pre-cast concrete piles can be designed for compression and nominal tension and bending, accommodation of compression and tension, and with full moment-transfer joints.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sheet or Vibro: Vibratory pile hammers contain a system of counter-rotating eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed in such a way that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel &quot;H&quot; piles used in temporary foundation shoring (sheet piling).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;identify excavated soils and types of rock&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;apply first aid “At Work”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 479px;&quot; width=&quot;479&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;479&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On completion of this apprenticeship, Piling Attendants will have knowledge of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the principles of health, safety welfare and environmentally responsible work practices and how they must be applied in relation to the work and to others&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;operatives responsibilities under current legislation and official guidance to undertake the work&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to communicate with others and follow organisational procedures to conform to productive work practices including sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to support piling operations including the duties and responsibilities of other members of the piling team&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to interpret types of information, drawings, method statements, risk assessments, manufacturers’ information, work schedules and specifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how building information modelling supports piling operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to handle and move loads manually and with mechanical aids&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;what the specific requirements are for conducting lifting operations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to maintain tools, plant, machinery, lifting accessories and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to use and what the specific requirements are for operating plant, machinery and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to comply with quality requirements when working&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to rig and derig piling plant, machinery and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to transport, handle, pour, position, lay and protect concrete for curing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to take samples&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the techniques and characteristics of piling processes, to include, but not limited too; Continuous Flight Auger, Rotary Large Diameter, Driven – Pre-cast, sheet, and Vibro&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to recognise changes in geology while piling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;how to react in an emergency.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 479px;&quot; width=&quot;479&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;479&quot;&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective communication: &lt;/strong&gt;oral, written, electronic, listening, body language and presentation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect: &lt;/strong&gt;apply equality, diversity and inclusion in dealing with others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team work: &lt;/strong&gt;work effectively and safely with others under minimum supervision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent working: &lt;/strong&gt;take responsibility for safe completion of your own work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical thinking: &lt;/strong&gt;use clear and valid reasoning when making decisions to undertake the work instructions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working effectively: &lt;/strong&gt;undertake the work in a reliable, safe and productive manner.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time management: &lt;/strong&gt;use own time effectively to complete the work instructions to schedule.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptability: &lt;/strong&gt;be able to adjust to changes to the work instructions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assertiveness and confidence: &lt;/strong&gt;able to resist pressures to work following unsafe practices&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individuals undertaking this standard will need to achieve the Level 2 National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) in Piling Operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Progression and Professional Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Progression from the Level 2 Apprenticeship could lead to Level 3 in specialist piling operations or with experience and maturity Occupational Work Supervision (Piling) within the construction industry.
