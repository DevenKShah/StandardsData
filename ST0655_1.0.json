  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the furniture, furnishings and interiors manufacturing industry, this is a substantial growth industry for the UK.&#160; The UK furniture, bed and furnishings manufacturing part of the industry is substantial. Over 8,000 companies contribute &#163;11 billion to the countryâ€™s GDP.&#160; In addition to this, there is a large market for contract and office furniture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to manufacture furniture and furniture components, such as desk lids, doors, casings or legs, using Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) machinery to perform precision tasks.&#160; This includes setting, loading and proving (testing) CNC programmes to produce furniture and/or components, setting up, operating and maintaining CNC furniture production machinery, improving CNC processes to produce furniture efficiently and finding and rectifying faults with furniture production machinery.&#160; Advanced Furniture CNC Technicians also produce and maintain jigs and templates to produce furniture components and create and modify programmes for producing furniture using Computer Aided Design (CAD).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of colleagues including production/manufacturing managers, quality technicians, production leaders, designers, product developers, training coordinators, production operatives and engineers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Advanced Furniture CNC Technicians can work in a range of environments from small workshops to large factories and may be required to work various shift patterns.&#160; An employee in this occupation will be responsible for producing machined components to meet specifications, maintaining quality and safety standards and maintaining equipment.&#160; They may also be responsible for a team, coaching, mentoring, training and developing individuals depending on the size of the organisation they work in.&lt;/p&gt;",
