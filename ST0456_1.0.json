  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;The following Standard reflects employers’ requirements for the skills, knowledge and behaviours expected from someone to be competent in the job role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Occupational Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The engineering sector is key to the UK economy and generates just over one quarter of total UK GDP. Engineering employers are projected to need over 180k people with engineering skills each year to 2022 and to help meet this requirement we need to double the number of graduates entering the industry. Our universities currently produce about 25k engineering and technology first degrees each year. The Post Graduate Engineer Standard will be critical in meeting the sector’s future skills needs. They will work in an area that covers a wide range of generic engineering disciplines which could include for example: software, integrated systems, mechanical, electrical, electronic, electromechanical, fluid power components/systems and materials. Typical occupations include:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Research and Development Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Design and Development Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Systems Integration Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Quality Assurance/Compliance Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Test / Qualification Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Manufacture / Production Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintenance / Test Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Product Support (inc logistics) Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Decommissioning/ Disposal Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Supply Chain/Procurement&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Engineering Business Manager&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Post Graduate Engineers develop solutions to engineering problems using new or existing technologies, through innovation, creativity and change and may have technical accountability for complex systems with their associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical job titles:&#160;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Engineer, Research Engineer, Development Engineer, Design Engineer, Systems Integration Engineer, Quality Assurance Engineer, Test Engineer, Production Engineer and Engineering Business Manager.&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Knowledge &amp;amp; Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Post Graduate Engineers are able to demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the theoretical knowledge to solve problems in existing and emerging technologies, applying and developing analytical techniques&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understanding of business and commercial needs/constraints&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;knowledge and understanding of own competencies capabilities and limitations, ability to work within these and highlight when work goes outside of these&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understanding of financial responsibilities and authorisation processes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understanding of technical sign off responsibilities, who within their organisation needs to be involved in the sign off of product/processes&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;Skills:&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;safe working practices, an understanding of technical governance and quality management&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;compliance with legislation and codes, but be able to seek improvements&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;practical competence to deliver innovative products and services&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;technical responsibility for complex engineering systems&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;accountability for project(s)/programme(s), finance and personnel management&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;management of trade-offs between technical and socio-economic factors&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the skill sets necessary to develop other technical staff&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;r&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Modern Engineering organisations require their employees to have a set of behaviours that will ensure success, both in their role and in the overall company objectives.

Their work involves the design of prototype experimental projects to progress the technology idea and highlight the areas of value to be taken to further Technology Readiness Levels (TRL).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Research and development engineers are involved in investigating areas of research which can enhance productivity and quality of processes. Projects range in scale and duration but focus on developing robust and world-leading methods of manufacture, often working with both academia and employers ultimately resulting in embedding the outcome of the research in either employers’ processes and/or manufacturing line. They are expected to work both individually and as part of a team, working with multiple customers and supporting the scoping of new work and deliver defined projects. They will need to have a high standard of technical authorships, be able to manage their time effectively and follow quality and project management procedures. They will be able to work with minimum supervision, taking on responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pecific Specialist Knowledge and Skills &lt;/strong&gt;- Through applying theoretical knowledge, understanding and academic principles, they will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Specialist Knowledge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understand the unpredictability of research projects and the need to adapt and adjust daily planning needs to accommodate new developments.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;understand how to analyse and interpret data, both quantitative and qualitative, in order to inform research and development decisions/strategies&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Specialist Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;adapt and adjust daily planning needs to accommodate new developments as a result of the unpredictability of research projects.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;analyse and record data to aid the design of future research and produce useful findings for other academics, funders, policy makers and practitioners.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;prepare materials (work piece, tooling, fixtures, etc.) such as set up equipment for experiments, carry out research, run samples and experiments, and interpret&lt;br /&gt;results to obtain data for research.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;contribute to research by acquiring and interpreting research data, ensuring that the methodology and purpose are defined in advance and contribute to the&lt;br /&gt;development of new techniques, models and methods.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;undertake research, collate, organise and edit material for inclusion in reports and other documents, ensuring that data results are presented in a professional and concise manner.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;plan and allocate work and responsibilities over the short-medium term, with an awareness of longer term issues.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;plan in advance to meet details for project reports, journal publications and to support presentations and papers for conferences.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.
