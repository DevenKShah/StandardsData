The dispensation will last from 31/08/24 to 30/09/26 but may be withdrawn if the assessment plan is revised sooner or the dispensation is no longer necessary.&nbsp;\nEnd-point assessment organisations (EPAOs) delivering EPAs for the apprenticeship will implement the dispensation as required, supported and monitored by the relevant EQA provider. &nbsp;\nThe key changes are:&nbsp;\nThis dispensation will replace the Observational Practical Assessment (OPA) with an extended question and answer (Q&amp;A) session informed by specific video and photographic evidence to set requirements. All EPAOs must deliver the assessment according to the dispensation to support comparability for learners.&nbsp;\nThe video evidence must be comprised of 2 set tasks that target a range of KSBs that are mapped to the OPA. Each task will require video evidence (up to a maximum of 15 minutes each) and should be captured in the workplace or other suitable environment. The tasks may be simulated where required (e.g. to support seasonal availability) though examples of genuine real-world activities that align with the evidence requirements are preferred where possible. The photographic evidence will support the video evidence by capturing other areas of performance against the KSBs not covered by the 2 main tasks. The quantity of images will vary depending on the nature of the KSBs being captured. The EPAO must provide clear details of the requirements for each type of evidence (both video and photographic) that the apprentice must capture.&nbsp;\nBoth the video and photographic evidence should typically be obtained during the post-gateway period but can be obtained a maximum of 4 weeks prior to the apprentice’s gateway date (to avoid any crossover with the portfolio of evidence). All evidence must be submitted to the EPAO 10 days prior to the Q&amp;A session taking place to allow appropriate questions to be generated/ selected by the EPAO/ assessor. The video and photographic evidence will be reviewed by both the apprentice and assessor during the Q&amp;A session. The main focus of assessment is the responses (supported by reference to the required evidence) offered by the apprentice during the Q&amp;A session. The Q&amp;A session will be a maximum of 2 hours (inclusive of reviewing all evidence such as playing the video evidence). The Q&amp;A session may take place remotely.; A&nbsp;revised version of this occupational standard and end-point assessment plan has been agreed and is available for information only at present. In the meantime, the version below remains approved for delivery. Further details of this and other apprenticeship standards in revision are available in the revisions status report.",
