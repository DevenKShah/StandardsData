The main duties and tasks for each role are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heritage Engineering Aviation Technicians:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with all aircraft types and technologies both Civil and Military from the very earliest wood and fabric aircraft and associated artefacts from the pioneering days of aviation through to the latest exotic composites used in prototypes donated to Museums. They employ the tools, technologies, techniques, practices and procedures appropriate to either the date of original manufacture or the point in time that a conserved, restored or replica aircraft or associated artefact represents.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2 - Heritage Engineering Marine Technicians: &lt;/strong&gt;&#160;Maintain, service, operate, repair, restore and conserve traditional and historical vessels. They can be propelled by sail, oar or, powered by electric, steam, petrol or diesel prime movers and where the fabric of the vessel may be constructed of wood, iron, steel or composites. They carry out routine maintenance and restoration understanding the importance of retaining historic fabric as well as the original design and functionality of the vessel. Also when using modern materials, they must to be able to apply their use in a sympathetic manner ensuring the original vessel structure, design and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 3 - Heritage Engineering &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam (Mechanical Overhaul)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Technicians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore, conserve, repair and remanufacture the wheels, bearings, motion, frames and associated equipment and fittings including valves, cylinders and pistons, brake systems, pipework, and similar features of the steam engine as found in a range of designs of locomotive created over the last 150 years and in steam ships, road locomotives and stationary engines, including modern replicas.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 4 - Heritage Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Steam (Boiler-smith) Technicians:&lt;/strong&gt; Restore, conserve, repair and remanufacture heritage steam boilers and associated equipment and fittings including pipework, boiler mountings, safety valves and fusible plugs, washout plugs, mud doors and similar, working with a range of boiler designs created over the last century or more, including modern replicas, and found in steam road and railway engines, steam ships and boats and stationary engines.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 5 - Heritage Engineering Vehicle Mechanical Technicians: &lt;/strong&gt;Due to the complex nature and range of the vehicles and the risks they present, must comply with a significantly more complex range of legislation than those for conventional modern vehicles.
