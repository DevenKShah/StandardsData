  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;Composites manufacture is the combining of materials to form a lighter and stronger rigid structure as an alternative to metal. These lightweight rigid structures are essential in the Aerospace, Automotive, Marine and Renewables industries and are becoming increasingly important in the Oil &amp;amp; Gas, Construction and Rail sectors. The composite industry therefore has an increasing requirement for skilled employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Composites Technician employed within a Composites Manufacturing environment will find themselves at the heart of cutting edge technologies using state of the art equipment and will become a skilled resource that will be an enabler for manufacturing technologies, processes and practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Composites Technician is engaged in a variety of processes in the production and creation of materials and components that are used in a range of applications including but not limited to: airplanes, cars, boats, turbine blades, oil &amp;amp; gas rigs, bridges, trains and satellites. They provide specialised knowledge and skills that support manufacturing programmes and projects and may be deployed in the areas of design, tooling, moulding, lay-up, curing, machining, inspection, testing, repair and material production. As the Technician grows in competence and expertise, other areas of composites technology such as automated manufacture development, preform technologies, processing technologies, validation and post processing, may form part of their role and responsibility&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job Titles: Composites Designer, Composites Tool-Maker, Composites Laminator, Composites Inspector, Composites Repairer, Composite Materials Technician.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Apprenticeship Entry Requirements and Duration&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each employer will stipulate their own entry requirements but it is likely that many will seek a Grade A* to C in Maths, English and a Science or Technology based subject.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The typical duration of this apprenticeship will be 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge, Skills and behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All technicians employed in the Composites sector will need to develop specialist knowledge, skills and behaviours.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Composite technicians work in the process manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Composite components are used in the aerospace, automotive, construction, furniture, marine, medical, motorsport, oil and gas, rail, and renewables industries and many more. Composite products include doors, prosthetic limbs, shower trays, and tennis rackets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Composites combine polymeric resins (plastics) and a reinforcing material such as carbon fibre, glass fibre, or Kevlar to produce a material with improved properties. For example, increased strength or stiffness without significantly increasing the weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Composite technicians produce polymer matrix composite (thermoset and thermoplastics) components or final products to a specification. They may combine the composite elements or use a pre-prepared material to produce the product using a variety of moulding processes. The processes require manual dexterity and skills. Production tends to be in batches and conducted in small-scale production facilities. Quality and process control is part of the role. They conduct quality assurance processes, check equipment and tooling for future usability, complete documentation, and participate in improvement activities.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work with other members of the manufacturing team. They also have contact with other functions for example, process engineers, maintenance engineers, laboratory staff, supply chain staff, and warehouse staff. They may also have contact with external people such as customers, service providers, suppliers, and regulators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must ensure that the process and products meet quality specifications and are produced to schedule. They must comply with health and safety, regulations and procedures including wearing personal protection equipment (PPE). They also need to meet environmental and sustainability regulations and procedures – minimising waste and recycling materials. They may work alone or as part of a team with minimal supervision. They are responsible for the quality and accuracy of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;",
