At this level, they will typically be working for a more senior transport planning professional and may have some line management responsibilities of technicians. Transport Planners often work with other professionals across their organisation, including those involved in planning, environmental assessment, engineering and construction, but they also liaise with a wide range of stakeholders including the general public and regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading smaller projects, and/or playing a key role in a larger programme, managing their own work with a high level of autonomy, reviewing technical input from others, responding positively to complex and unpredictable situations, and be able to influence and make decisions that support others in or external to their own organisation.&#160; They will operate effectively within organisational, financial and resource constraints, comply with policy and regulatory requirements, whilst maintaining high levels of professional conduct, ethical behaviour and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typical job titles include:&#160; &lt;/strong&gt;Transport Planner, Senior Transport Planner, Transport Planning and Strategic Advisor, Transport Policy Advisor, Transport Planning Consultant, Transport Economist, Transport Modeller.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DUTIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 20%;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Topic&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this occupation a fully competent employee can:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For this duty, list the important performance considerations for employers in terms of how the work is to be done and to what standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 15%;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Days required to complete off the job (OTJ) training for this duty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1.

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in small specialist firms to large multi-national and multi-disciplinary consultancies, to local authorities, Government departments and agencies. Transport planners may be found in academia, research organisations, in providers of infrastructure and transport operators, and with developers and financing companies with transport interests. The broad purpose of the occupation is to design and develop transport and travel systems, which are safe to operate, environmentally sustainable, and take into account access needs for everyone. Transport planners apply advanced theoretical knowledge and methods of transport planning, analyse and interpret complex interconnected data, utilise transport modelling and appraisal techniques, determine the key outputs from proposed plans, how they meet customer specifications and fulfil local and national policies, and evaluate the impact of possible transport solutions. Transport planners now increasingly integrate new technologies that improve the management of our transport systems to make more informed forecasts, support intelligent mobility and change people’s attitudes to travel, for example, through Smart Vehicle and Travel schemes. They link transport on a local to international scale, which helps shape the future of our towns and cities, support economic growth, protect the environment, and improve social cohesion. In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their own team, each contributing to the delivery of transport projects, processes and policies. At this level, they will typically be working for a more senior transport planning professional and may have some line management responsibilities of technicians. Transport Planners often work with other professionals across their organisation, including those involved in planning, environmental assessment, engineering and construction, but they also liaise with a wide range of stakeholders including the general public and regulatory bodies. An employee in this occupation will be responsible for leading smaller projects, and/or playing a key role in a larger programme, managing their own work with a high level of autonomy, reviewing technical input from others, responding positively to complex and unpredictable situations, and be able to influence and make decisions that support others in or external to their own organisation. They will operate effectively within organisational, financial and resource constraints, comply with policy and regulatory requirements, whilst maintaining high levels of professional conduct, ethical behaviour and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;",
