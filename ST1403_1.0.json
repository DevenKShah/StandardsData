  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoPlainText&quot;&gt;This occupation is found in the maritime sector which can include ships and submarines involved in defence and it also can be found in commercial shipping.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to work from engineering drawings, data and documentation in order to undertake the manufacture, installation, testing, fault diagnosis, maintenance, overhaul and removal of electrical systems on maritime vessels. This could cover propulsion machinery, weapons, sensors, reactor or auxiliary systems (such as water, air conditioning, electronic equipment including programmable logic controllers, power generation and distribution). It requires knowledge and expertise in the use of common and specialist electrical equipment, machines and hand tools, and the use of a variety of measuring and diagnostic equipment and processes to ensure individual components and assemblies meet the required specification. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of other stakeholders such as other electrical fitters, supervisors, engineers and colleagues. They could be based on a submarine or ship or could be shore-based working on ships and submarines in dock, or within a workshop environment. The role could involve working in confined spaces. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for complying with statutory regulations and organisational safety requirements and they will be expected to work both individually and as part of a team. They will be able to work with minimal supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake and will be proactive in finding solutions to problems and identifying areas to improve business processes.&lt;/p&gt;",
