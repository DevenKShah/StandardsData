  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;The occupation of community fire safety advisor can be found in the fire and rescue sector and other partner agencies. The fire sector is formed of three functions; prevention, protection and response. The occupation of community fire safety advisor is a role within the prevention function, linking closely with protection and response.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A community fire safety advisor works to educate local communities to adopt safer behaviours. This includes providing advice, guidance and interventions that support people to remain safe and reduce from risks of harm such as fire, falls, crime or due to the circumstances in which the individual is living. The broad purpose of the occupation is to impart education as part of Fire and Rescue statutory duty. This is done through planning and undertaking home fire safety visits, providing advice and guidance to members of the community, and fitting fire safety equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation will interact effectively with the community, partner agencies and colleagues to provide advice and guidance to members of the community. The community fire safety advisor will use the Person Centred Framework for Home Fire Safety Visits (HFSVs), local policy, procedures and guidance, in addition to delivering community safety initiatives to improve the overall safety of the public. Community fire safety advisors work at functional level within the fire sector, but they do not usually work at supervisory level or manage others.&lt;/p&gt;",
