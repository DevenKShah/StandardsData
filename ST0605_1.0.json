  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in the hazardous Mineral Products Industry which includes quarrying and deep mining. The industry directly employs 78,000 people in the UK and supplies industries with a combined turnover of &#163;495bn. The Mineral Products Industry is a vital enabling sector of the UK economy and is the largest element of the construction supply chain, providing the raw materials to support major infrastructure and building projects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to ensure that sufficient materials and products are available to meet customer requirements whilst ensuring all health, safety, environmental and quality requirements/legislation are complied with. This is carried out by supervising and coordinating operations in a safe manner whilst maintaining production to meet customer needs as well as optimising production and maintaining facilities to a high standard. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work an employee in this occupation interacts with colleagues within and outside their organisation across all departments, including managers at all levels, contract labour, customers and members of the public. Typically this includes a balance between office and outside work observing and carrying out operational tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typical responsibilities include: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• optimising the effectiveness of their team by actively participating in daily/weekly briefings, appraisals and reviews; &lt;br /&gt;• working with all members of the management team to continually raise the Health, Safety and Environmental standards of the company; &lt;br /&gt;• ensuring all contractors who carry out work on-site are inducted, monitored and supervised to ensure safe working practices are adhered to;&lt;br /&gt;• ensuring that all plant and equipment is maintained to a high standard and all production systems and products comply with all current quality standards; &lt;br /&gt;• ensuring all company and regulatory inspections and reports and completed; &lt;br /&gt;• liaising with the sales team and customers to ensure the site delivers the highest standard in customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for the safe operation of the site and maximising productivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Product Technicians are employed across several mineral extractive industries. These industries include quarrying, concrete production, cement manufacture, cementitious products, asphalt production, ashphalt laying and clay manufacture. They require a detailed technical understanding of the part of the mineral extractive industry in which they work. These key specialist areas are aligned to the titles of the apprenticeship options as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Mineral Extraction&lt;br /&gt;• Concrete (Readymix and Precast/Prestressed)&lt;br /&gt;• Cement and cementitious products&lt;br /&gt;• Asphalt &amp;amp; Pavements&lt;br /&gt;• Clays (Heavy and White)&lt;/p&gt;",
