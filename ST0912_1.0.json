  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in the creative and decorative arts as well as architectural and construction industries, often within the heritage sector.&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The term ‘stained glass’ will for ease be used throughout this document. However, the term covers all forms of lead glazing, lead lights, quarry glazing, etc. and encompasses a broad range of techniques e.g. glass painting and staining, printing, enameling, etching, sand blasting, bonding, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Typically, much of the work will take place in a specialist studio with a small amount of work taking place on-site. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Projects may include but are not limited to commissioned stained glass design and construction as well as stained glass repair or restoration. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is the research, design, craft, construction and fitting of stained glass.&lt;span&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;This includes conservation and restoration of stained glass as well as working on new commissions or architectural projects. These projects range from small to large-scale public and private commissions, that can involve the research, design and construction of new and existing stained glass within historical and/or contemporary contexts in public or domestic buildings. The occupation requires skills in dealing with people and working as a member of a team, researching and analysing sometimes historical and technical information, and creativity in designing to include drawing and rendering stained glass cartoons and cutline drawings. In addition to this the occupation requires hand skills in the handling and cutting of glass, glass painting, leading, soldering and cementing. All these skills are considered essential to creating stained glass. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other members of their team and their supervisor within a workshop setting, and with members of the general public, clients, suppliers and other contractors when discussing projects or working on-site. An employee in this occupation will be required to handle glass artefacts, designs, tools and materials in a responsible and professional manner, and to participate in the maintenance of&lt;span&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;health and safety standards for themselves and their team. They are required to act responsibly, exercise sound judgement and analysis of information and demonstrate good practice in the undertaking of specialist projects which are sometimes of historical significance and value. These standards would apply regardless of the sizes of employer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Typically, a person in this occupation would be working under supervision from a more senior and experienced team member. Teams are in the main made up of apprentices/trainees&lt;span&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;and a small number of professionals who work under the management of the studio director.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
