For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. British Sign Language qualification is an alternative to English qualifications for those whom this is their primary language.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualification&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in Food Engineering&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Renewal&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed after 3 years&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Professional Recognition&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Completion of the apprenticeship is designed to be recognised by the relevant professional institutions as contributing towards the appropriate level of professional registration (Incorporated Engineer). However, it is recognised that additional experiential evidence may be required.&lt;/p&gt;",
