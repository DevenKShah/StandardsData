  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This occupation is found in organisations of all sizes across all sectors where personal and commercial data is processed. Data protection and information governance practitioners work in varied environments including in an office, onsite, or remotely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to provide regulatory and technical advice and guidance providing assurance to key stakeholders and regulators of compliance with information governance (IG) and data protection (DP) requirements. Organisations must comply with information governance legislation to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its information assets. The data protection and information governance practitioner (DP&amp;amp;IGP) will contribute to the annual work plan and assist in the planning and organisation of IG, ethics and DP activities. The DP&amp;amp;IGP will also provide advice and training with regard to improving data management and will support the senior team in the development and delivery of operational and strategic information requirements. The role requires work to be undertaken under explicit and legally defined timeframes (for example, data breaches must be reported within 72 hours and Data Subject Access Requests must be fulfilled within one calendar month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with a range of internal stakeholders including members of their own team, other departments such as IT, legal, HR, marketing, senior management and the board of directors. They also interact with external stakeholders such as members of the public, customers, Supervisory Authorities, The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), technology vendors, academics, industry bodies, external legal departments, human rights organisations, consumer rights organisations and law enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for assisting the organisation in its compliance with information governance and data protection best practice and associated laws and regulations. They will oversee and manage the day-to-day coordination of information requests such as data subject rights, freedom of information and environmental information regulations. In addition, they will oversee compliance with Information and Records Management for example the development and maintenance of retention schedules. They assist in the maintenance and administration of the organisations’ information and governance framework such as corporate information management, records of processing activity, developing privacy notices, conducting information audits and data breach investigations. On occasion the DP&amp;amp;IGP supports projects through ensuring privacy by design and default. They may also conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) and third-party supplier due diligence. They analyse data and develop briefings for senior leadership on data protection and information governance controls. They may investigate information governance complaints and incidents from internal or external stakeholders. This role will work on their own and in a range of team settings. They work within agreed budgets and available resources. The DP&amp;amp;IGP work without high levels of supervision, usually reporting to senior stakeholders. They may occasionally be responsible for decision making, but more often will guide or influence the decisions of others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
