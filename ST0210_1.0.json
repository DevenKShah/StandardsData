Working in the outdoor environment is a healthy and therapeutic activity, which contributes to the well-being of employees as well as users of sports surfaces. With the vast range of natural or artificial turf pitches available, throughout the UK and world-wide, now is an excellent time to join this well-established and dynamic profession.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

These are:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Compliance with environmental and health and safety legislation and regulations&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Compliance with policies and procedures – company, client, health and safety risk assessments, rules of the game from the different Governing Bodies of Sport&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The identification and correct application of materials, tools, equipment and machinery used in maintenance and renovation activities&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Identification and understanding of different grasses, soil types, weeds, pests, diseases, turf disorders, artificial surfacing material, underlays, infill material, turf and soil reinforcement material, line marking materials&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The principles of photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration in the growth and development of plants&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The impact of weather, ground conditions and usage on pitch quality and playing quality&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The different Performance Quality Standards for a range of different sports turf surfaces&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to minimise waste and reduce environmental impacts&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;How to monitor, record and report basic grounds maintenance findings.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.

In order to do this they will need to be capable of the following:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Maintain and renovate turf surfaces in a safe and appropriate way to ensure games can take place which provide for a fair, safe and exciting contest for players. This will include the safe use of a range of equipment and machinery, such as mowers, scarifiers, aerators and other specialist turf care equipment, covering hand tools, as well as pedestrian operated, ride-on and tractor mounted implements&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Correctly calibrate equipment for material requirements and apply at the correct rates a range of materials, including grass seed, fertiliser and bulky top-dressing&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Use integrated prevention and control methods to reduce the incidence of diseases, disorders, pests and weeds on turf&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Set and mark out sports areas in accordance with the Laws of the Governing Bodies of Sport&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain tools, equipment and machinery used for maintenance and renovation activities to ensure their safe and effective use&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Maintain and conduct basic routine servicing and repairs to drainage and irrigation systems&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate with others and provide an excellent level of customer service&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Work safely, efficiently and effectively at all times, whether under supervision, as an individual, or in a team&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.
