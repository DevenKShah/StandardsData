Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will identify any relevant entry requirements in terms of previous qualifications or other criteria. Our recommendation of entry requirements is below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GCSE Maths &amp;amp; English - grade C or above (or equivalent).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;2 x A Level (or equivalent) - minimum grade C&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following qualifications meet the requirements for the Trailblazer Apprenticeship for Paralegals. They do not represent an exhaustive list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CILEx Level 3 Diploma in Providing Legal Services&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Completing this standard should also provide exemptions for the Solicitor Apprentice standard and the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Legal Executive standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English &amp;amp; Maths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to taking the End-Point Assessment. For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement, the apprenticeshipâ€™s English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3. A British Sign Language (BSL) qualification is an alternative to the English qualification for those whose primary language is BSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a Level 3 Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Review date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard will be reviewed in three years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;ST0245changelog&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Paralegals work alongside law professionals such as solicitors and chartered legal executives. A paralegal mainly gives legal advice on routine and straightforward matters. They support other legal professionals including on regulated aspects of law. A paralegal can be found in many contexts, from small legal firms on the high street to large multi-nationals. They can work in the private or public sector. They can work within in-house legal departments, legal services firms, not-for-profit sector and charities.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Paralegal is a profession providing legal support whilst working under supervision. It can also be a typical entry point into the legal sector. A paralegal receives work and requests from many people at once, as well as having their own duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The ability to work under pressure and to meet deadlines is essential because people will be relying upon the paralegal to complete their tasks. A paralegal may sometimes be asked to make judgements within specific limits on legal or working matters. Paralegals at all levels interact with clients, lawyers and other stakeholders such as the police, courts, government or regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; They need to convey complex data clearly, sometimes in emotionally charged or difficult circumstances. They will be involved in supporting the team and use problem-solving skills to help get the best outcomes for the client and their organisation. Some paralegals may be doing this work on behalf of their own clients. They will be working in a regulated context and so high professional and ethical standards are vital. Paralegals research and analyse lots of complex data, keeping a high level of precision and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Paralegal work can include things such as drafting legal documents, contacting clients and assisting with meetings and governance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A paralegal is usually office based, although they may assist at court or attend meetings with clients at off-site locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The role can vary widely depending on the practice area. For example, if working in conveyancing then a paralegal is less likely to have much face-to-face contact with clients. However, if assisting on criminal work, then a paralegal may need to assist lawyers attending court and police stations and talk to suspects. Paralegals qualified to work in criminal law may also be Police Station Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A paralegal will administer data and records. They will review documents and produce legal documents and standard forms using digital tools. A paralegal will handle confidential and sensitive data daily and so recognising data protection requirements is critical to the role. This extends to recognising the risks to data from cybercrime and the need to be vigilant. A paralegal will interpret and use basic financial data when assisting clients and other stakeholders. They will ensure that any tasks involving monies are carried out in compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Paralegals can go on to be partners in law firms, heads of legal departments in the private or public sector. They may decide to form their own legal services company providing legal services direct to litigants in person. In some instances in the lower courts, for example, some tribunals and small claims courts, paralegals may be granted the rights of audience. This means that they can advocate for their own clients directly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Paralegals have become the fastest growing role within the legal services sector. They are often found in organisations offering legal services direct to clients&lt;/p&gt;",
