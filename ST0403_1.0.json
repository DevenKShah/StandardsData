The vehicles can include cars and light commercial vehicles. A technician is able to work independently and as part of a team following a defined process, using their skills to correctly identify the different body panel types and have the ability to use the correct repair tools to carry out the work to the highest possible standard. With motor vehicle technology changing all the time panel technicians keep up to date with the most relevant equipment and advanced repair techniques within the automotive industry. They do so by adhering to the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;manufacturer’s literature and modification bulletins. The equipment they use can include using jigs, resistance welding equipment, riveting and bonding tools, as well as new equipment such as Reinforced Plastic Carbon Fibre diagnostic ultrasound tools. A competent Vehicle Damage Panel Technician will meet the following competency requirements.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Expert working knowledge &amp;amp; understanding of:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle chassis and body alignment, e.g. underbody measurement and its impact on suspension and steering geometry&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vehicle body types, panel identification, safety systems, materials and alternative fuel&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use of Body Panel Repair tools, equipment and devices used in the process e.g. alignment jigs, resistance welding equipment, riveting and bonding tools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Removal and replacement of body panels and associated parts e.g. mechanically fixed components, chemically fixed components&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interpretation of technical data for joining techniques and replacement panels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quality control process and the implications of poor quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of key process for vehicle panel repair such as Welding utilising either Tungsten, Inert Gas (TIG) and Metal, Inert Gas (MIG) &amp;amp; brazing along with spot welding, riveting utilising self-piercing rivets and utilising panel adhesive bonding as specified by the manufacturer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Health &amp;amp; Safety and compliance requirements of the bodyshop industry&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Their direct commercial productivity and efficiency impact of their role within the whole repair process.
