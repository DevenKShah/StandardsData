  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This occupation is found in the transport sector, across a range of different types of organisations such as airlines, train operators (overground and underground), bus and coach companies, tram operators and the military. These travel networks span the UK and beyond. Many travel networks cover multiple routes and services that connect to provide integrated travel solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;This occupation is found in diverse settings. It includes operators that provide public transport, commercial and military operators. Those working in this occupation help meet a wide range of different transport needs and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers provide support to key teams such as flight crews or bus drivers. They may be required to work on site, which could include commercial airports, bus/train/tram stations or military bases. They are also found off site in remote offices, a small control location, or a major operations control room.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to help ensure that transport services operate safely, efficiently and effectively by having all the necessary requirements at the right time and place.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers typically plan, review and develop timetables to help network operations meet service delivery requirements. They also plan the rostering of the onboard crew and any support staff that will be needed. They provide support during the live service, which may mean monitoring vehicle/aircraft progress or providing guidance.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&#160; &lt;/span&gt;Finally, they may need to arrange for the resources needed, which could include the vehicle or any parts that are required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Ultimately, transport schedulers help passengers and customers get to their destinations safely and on time. Transport schedulers therefore play a key role in delivering successful transport operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;People in this occupation sometimes work normal office hours, but shift work may be expected, particularly where the travel network operates during unsociable hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with members of their immediate team and other stakeholders critical to its safe operation such as the onboard crew, crew management, ground staff, engineers and suppliers. Transport schedulers may work independently or as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers are responsible for delivering solutions to service stakeholders such as commercial managers and engineering managers and will collaborate with front-line staff and others involved in the scheduling process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for assessing and arranging the individual needs of travel service. To do this, they may consider (for instance) the vehicle/aircraft type, objective, the systems to be used, parts and repairs, the crew complement, and timing requirements. They may need to source these requirements, which may involve negotiation with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;They are responsible for the creation, maintenance, allocation and delivery of timetables, schedules, rosters and diagrams. As well as being compliant, timetables, schedules, rosters and diagrams will be optimised to help meet the organisations objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers typically risk assess and monitor several travel services at the same time. They must maintain safe and compliant operations while also prioritising their work to meet targets. They typically must allocate resources within a financial limit. They are responsible for ensuring all schedules/timetables and any bespoke requirements meet quality standards in line with legislative and organisational operating procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers may be required to capture and analyse a wide range of performance data and information. They use this when reviewing and validating their solutions against existing services, business requirements and contracts, and customer standards. They may make recommendations to senior management on improvements. The kinds of improvements they look at might impact, for instance, customer service, compliance, the environment and sustainability, performance, industrial relations, or safety and financial efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers sometimes encounter degraded travel conditions, or unexpected incidents on the route. They may also be required to handle responses in serious emergency situations that can be highly challenging and require rapid analysis and problem-solving to provide alternative travel solutions. They are also expected to provide short-term solutions for planned work, for example providing adjustments while repair work is undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Transport schedulers are accountable for their own area of work. Effective handovers to team members in the production timeline as well as at the end of a shift are a key feature, that ensures that transport services receive the required support. They typically work to a line manager, who is often a technical expert. They will be required to escalate issues that are beyond their own jurisdiction to their line manager or relevant technical expert.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
