  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A technician scientist carries out established laboratory based investigations and basic scientific experimentation using bench and instrumentation techniques. They use a range of routine skills and some advanced and specialised skills following well established principles associated with their organisation’s science and technology, which may typically be within chemical, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, formulated products or analytical services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They carry out routine lines of enquiry, development or investigation taking responsibility for the quality of the work they undertake. They work safely and ethically often under highly regulated conditions because of the need to control quality and safety of scientific products.&#160; They critically evaluate appropriateness of commonly used approaches to solving routine problems, using a range of approaches to formulate evidence based responses to defined and routine problems and issues within their area of work. They also contribute to solutions to problems within the wider scientific team, using appropriate project management procedures&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;They perform record keeping and checks and use data capture systems relevant to the technical and scientific procedures that they use. They analyse relevant scientific information, interpret and evaluate data, prepare results and provide progress updates of their work. They manage resources within a clearly defined area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They use their awareness of any research interests and the technical context and processes of the laboratory alongside senior team members to contribute to the proposal of new scientific ideas. They have an up to date knowledge of technical, scientific and regulatory developments related to the conduct of the laboratory. They communicate information, arguments and analysis in a variety of forms to specialist and non-specialist audiences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They work as part of a wider scientific team, which may include laboratory scientists and laboratory technicians, in settings where there is certainty and with limited ambiguity taking personal responsibility for decision making in routine predictable contexts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include; Analytical Support Chemist, Technical Support Scientist, Microbiology Support Scientist, Process Development Technologist, Laboratory Assistant, Senior Laboratory Technician, Assistant Scientist, Technical Specialist&#160; (Scientist), Quality Control Laboratory Assistant, Laboratory Co-ordinator, Technical Laboratory Assistant, Laboratory Analyst, Laboratory Research Assistant&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically candidates will have grade C or above in at least five GCSE’s, including English, maths and a science subject and hold relevant level 3 qualifications providing the appropriate number of UCAS points for entry to a level 5 HE programme.
