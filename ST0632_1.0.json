  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Prosthetic or Orthotic &#160;Technicians design and manufacture custom made devices to meet the specification / prescription determined by the Prosthetist/ Orthotist. In prosthetics this is an artificial limb (prostheses) in orthotics it can be a range of devices from diabetic footwear to spinal bracing (Orthoses). Using the specification/ prescription provided you will make devices that aid movement, correct deformity and relieve discomfort for adults and children.&#160; These devices are designed to replace, support or improve the functioning of a limb or the spine.&#160; You will have an understating of the clinical conditions that you may provide devices for include scoliosis, polio, spina bifida, multiple sclerosis, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, musculoskeletal injury and cerebral palsy. Some patients who use the devices may have congenital conditions such as being born with a limb missing or a limb or spine that has not formed fully; others have lost a limb through trauma from being in an accident or during military service; and others have lost a limb or part of limb due to disease as a result of their health condition eg diabetes.&#160; You will be a highly skilled individual able to work with many different types of materials and processes to manufacture their devices using the appropriate materials and technologies. You will work with a very high attention to detail and to very specific measurements, profiles and moulds as each device is bespoke to the patient, their conditions and functionality. As peopleâ€™s conditions and requirements change over time and technologies improve or change, you may continue to adapt devices. You may support patients over a long time as devices need to be changed / upgraded.&#160; You may also be required to support and supervise junior members of staff delegating tasks as appropriate.&#160; You will work for both the NHS or independent companies contracted to supply a service to the NHS, or work for a company that provides a private service direct to individuals.&#160; Some technicians work in a department based in a hospital environment or within a manufacturing unit away from a hospital base.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day to Day Activities include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan the design and manufacturing of a custom made device to meet the prescription and timescale, advise if there any issues which may cause difficulty in the production of the device&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide advice on technical solutions to achieve the goals for the patient to the Prosthetist/Orthotist.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Construct the device using the appropriate materials, and where appropriate using computer technology for the various stages of customised manufacture and fitting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Carry out finishing of custom made devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide technical assistance with the fitting of custom made devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively with healthcare professionals and service users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work directly with patients requiring mechanical repairs to their devices&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry:&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Individual employers will set selection criteria. This might include GCSEs, A levels, other relevant qualifications, relevant experience and/or an aptitude test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualification requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completing the end-point assessment.&#160; For those with an education, health and care plan or a legacy statement the apprenticeships English and maths minimum requirement is Entry Level 3 and British Sign Language qualification are an alternative to English qualifications for whom this is their primary language.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level: &lt;/strong&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration: &#160;&lt;/strong&gt;Typically 3 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Date: &lt;/strong&gt;After 3 years&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;You will be professional, skilled, caring, compassionate, conscientious, honest and trustworthy&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;You will treat people with dignity, respecting individual&#39;s diversity, beliefs, culture, needs, values, privacy and preferences.
