This duration may be reduced for a candidate with previous relevant experience and/or someone already part qualified. Alternatively this may also be a progression route from a relevant Advanced Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;uggested Entry Requirement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set the selection criteria for their Apprenticeships. In order to optimise success candidates will typically have 5 GCSE&#39;s at Grade C or above, including Mathematics, English and a Science, Technology or Engineering related subject, as well as A Levels at grade C or above in both a Mathematical based subject and a Science, Technology, Engineering or additional Mathematics related subject, or 90+ credits in an Engineering BTEC. The Apprenticeship as a Product Design and Development Technician provides a potential preparation route for this Apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Specific Occupational Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Product Design &amp;amp; Development Engineers work on all stages of product creation, product modification and product componentry. They support activities ranging on early concept feasibility, Computer Aided Design and other modelling, activities and stages through to final preparation for launch and customers. This includes working in concept studios, rapid prototyping, assembly, testing, validating and analysing performance. Typically they work closely with suppliers and managers in bring new concepts to life or contributing to redesigns of existing products.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ocational Skills: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the foundation stage the apprentice must develop a solid grasp of the core engineering skills. These skills will not only prepare the apprentice for the workplace in demonstrating that they have the required basic skills to do their core role but their competencies are stretching and transferable and can be built upon over time. The skills required are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to comply with statutory requirements and stringent organisational safety requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to effectively use, interpret and evaluate a range of engineering data sources and documentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Organising work efficiently and effectively in managing engineering resources when completing tasks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Producing components using hand fitting techniques and producing mechanical assemblies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Producing Electrical or Electronic Drawings or CAD Models using a CAD system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preparing and using lathes, milling and other general or specialist high tech equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applying mechanical, electrical and electronic devices and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using computer software packages to assist with engineering activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Producing and managing engineering project plans&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;During the development stage they would hone and deepen their general engineering skills in there specialist areas and also may undergo placements in relevant supportive functions to provide breadth of experience. With all of these skills, they will be using a well-planned logical and systematic approach.On successful completion of the above, the apprentice will then progress to develop their skills in:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Project Management in undertaking engineering activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Establishing design briefs, presenting and discussing technical proposals&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Managing and controlling product design change&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Supporting team feasibility design reviews.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrating technical and commercial management in planning and managing tasks &amp;amp; resources&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ademic Knowledge: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The apprentice would complete a HND or Foundation Degree which would provide the foundation stage of the knowledge elements in the competence qualification. It will support the fundamental scientific and mathematical principles that equip apprentices with the understanding required to operate effectively and efficiently at high level within this sector. As a core the engineer needs to cover around 960 academic Guided Learning Hours, in order to have a solid grasp of;-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mathematics and science for engineers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Materials and manufacture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mechanical. electrical and electronic principles and applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Statics and dynamics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to undertake and apply business-led projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engineering operations and business management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applying advanced technology techniques&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For the Development Phase the apprentice will build on their Foundation knowledge by completing a BSc (Hons) or BEng (Hons) in Engineering. Here they will expand their understanding to a higher level and commence on specialised modules during the latter part of this qualification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ccupational Behaviours: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Modern high value engineering organisations require their apprentices to have a set of occupational behaviours that will ensure success both in their current and future roles and in meeting the overall company objectives. These required behaviours include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;afety mindset: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This occupation sits within an industry with a high level of safety critical activities.

The foundation phase will be intensive off the job training focused on developing the apprentice&#39;s core skills, knowledge and behaviour, allowing them to work effectively with supervision in a largely simulated working environment. This stage will require typically 1400&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vocational Guided Learning Hours, building up from basics to more complex engineering operations and practices. The tasks will be aligned to the job role to develop a range of tailored core engineering techniques so by the end of this phase the apprentice will be able to demonstrate, under independent test conditions, that they can deploy their skills and occupational behaviours. In addition the apprentice typically undertakes an HND or Foundation Degree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The development phase will focus on applying the apprentice&#39;s on-job vocational competence supported by further guided learning, enabling them to eventually work effectively without the need for close supervision. The competencies gained are sufficiently transferable by the end of this development phase for someone to adapt quickly to function effectively after minimal instruction on new equipment / environments or revised working practices, whilst completing an Engineering Degree. There will be a robust synoptic employer endorsement as part of the final assessment of this phase to ensure that the apprentice has demonstrated full competence against the knowledge, skills and behaviours in this standard. The employer will sign off that the apprentice is ‘job ready’ as a competent Professional Design and Development Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pr&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ofessional Recognition and Career Progression: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This standard has been designed to meet the professional standards of the Engineering Council for initial registration as an Engineering Technician (Eng Tech) in partnership with the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Further professional development and registration is subject to candidates successfully completing the appropriate learning, developing the appropriate competence, and undergoing professional review.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;overnance &amp;amp; Review date: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;March 2016 by engineering employer led trailblazer collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; In order to articulate the specific level of skills, knowledge and behaviours required to be achieved and assessed to demonstrate full occupational competence, the employers on the trailblazer group have developed a more detailed Employer Occupational Brief s(EOB). These brief will inform the awarding organisations of the required elements of knowledge, behaviours and vocational skills within this Apprenticeship Standard. It will also provide a clear basis for the development of the assessment of this Apprenticeship and will enable the sector to maintain world class levels of quality and ensure that the credibility, transferability and consistency of the Apprenticeship outcome is maintained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Change log:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt;Last updated 9th April 2018&lt;/caption&gt;\n&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;DATE&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;CHANGE&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th&gt;PREVIOUS VERSIONS&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;span&gt;9th April 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Updated AP&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Additional detail and clarity provided for the end point assessment methods including details of grading descriptors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;&#160;Removal of mandatory on programme gateways, foundation phase end test and other references to foundation and development phases&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Removal of all mandatory qualifications with the exception of English and maths at level 2 and the requirement to achieve a BEng or BSc Degree prior to the EPA gateway&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gateway information included&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Roles and responsibilities section included&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resit/retake information included&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Internal quality assurance information included&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&#160;&#160;Confirmation that external quality assurance will be undertaken by the Institute for Apprenticeships&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Current assessment plan&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot; class=&quot;direction-ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;govuk-document-footer direction-ltr&quot; data-module=&quot;track-click&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;history&quot; class=&quot;history-information&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;published definition&quot;&gt;12 November 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Published AP&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/media/1725/product_design_and_development_engineer_01.pdf&quot; title=&quot;product_design_and_development_engineer_01.pdf&quot;&gt;Product design and development engineer AP_01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot; class=&quot;direction-ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;govuk-document-footer direction-ltr&quot; data-module=&quot;track-click&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;history&quot; class=&quot;history-information&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;published definition&quot;&gt;12 November 2014&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Published standard&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;Current standard&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td&gt;&#160;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;",
  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in cross sectors such as aerospace, automotive, motorsport, maritime and other product design engineering or manufacturing sectors. Employers may be directly involved in these activities or as a service provider, original equipment manufacturer or approved solutions provider in large or small to medium organisations providing services such as system design or development, product or component design or development. Products can form part of any mechanical, electrical or electromechanical systems, assemblies, components or complete integrated packages. Design and development of any products, whether they be concepts or approved for manufacture, must conform to appropriate standards and legislation, be environmentally and sustainability informed, and have a design considered approach to the end-to-end life cycle. To design or develop components, products or systems the engineer must be able to understand and apply core fundamentals in mathematics and scientific principles. It is typical for engineers in the industry to understand fundamentals principles such as calculus, equations, integration and differentiation, estimation, data collection and modelling, materials, international system of units, forces, mechanics and electrical and electronic theory. In a number of cases, engineers will have a deep understanding in a number of these areas.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to be able to plan and lead projects or other relevant programmes of work that provides critical analysis, continuous improvement and problem solving to support research, design and development activities. As part of the development of new products and technology, designers and engineers have to analyse requirements and consider any legal implications and limitations to ensure conformity to national or international legislation, standards or directives as well as complying with customer requirements. It is imperative that material properties, capabilities and failures are understood and recognised to allow appropriate material selection. Product design and development engineers use a range of computer packages in order to complete the design or development activity efficiently and effectively including presenting their conceptual ideas. They utilise cutting edge technology to realise a project from initial concept studies to integrated analysis of a complete system. This is made possible with the introduction of advanced Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software packages and the availability of Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software packages to support the design and development process. Complex, rigorous and extensive testing is utilised to reach the optimum of design and therefore can speed up the design and testing process through the use of simulation packages such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It is the job of the engineer to design, validate and maintain the mechanical, electrical or integrated system components to ensure they meet the required specification and customer requirements including taking into account how they may interact with other components or systems that could impact on factors such as safety, quality, reliability, performance, power, noise, vibration, harshness, speed, weight, heat generation, ingress of foreign bodies, signal interference and cyber security, are the day to day dealings of an engineer in this field. They must also consider environmental and sustainability when undertaking design and development activities such as material selection, recycling and reusability options The use of physical tools, software and simulation tools and utilising technologies for test, diagnostic and telemetry instruments are fundamental to carrying out tasks associated with designing, developing, testing, building, installing, verification testing and final release of products and any associated equipment or systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation will report to a senior manager or director and will normally be part of a multi-disciplinary team for example as a leader or member of a specialist project team that could include personnel from a range of functional areas such as senior design engineers, stress engineers, materials engineers, integration engineers, manufacturing engineers, quality engineers, production engineers, cost engineers, procurement managers or test engineers, maintenance engineer or installation and commissioning teams. This occupation can be plant based, office based, working in the field or a mixture of all of these areas. Some sectors may require the research or design engineers to work outside, such as at outdoor test facilities or in harsh environments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for ensuring the design, development and optimisation of mechanical or electrical systems, component or product performance, equipment integration or reliability and compliance of systems. Product design and development engineers will also be responsible for identifying and supporting opportunities for cost savings, efficiency and continued improvement in a business environment. They will exercise considerable judgement and autonomy for the work they undertake coupled with a high-level of personal decision making and influence, setting out recommendations and potential options to the employer or customer.&lt;/p&gt;",
