  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of the Embedded Electronic Systems Design and Development Engineer is to apply their knowledge of electronics and of embedded software to the design of circuits or devices that provide a useful function, that are capable of being manufactured at a competitive cost, and that are reliable and safe in use. This involves the use of the engineer’s knowledge of electronics and electronic principles, married to an expertise in the end use of the final product. In electronics this end use can cover a wide spectrum. Examples of industrial sectors that rely heavily on Embedded Systems Design and Development Engineers include Aerospace, Automotive, Automation and Instrumentation, Robotics, Telecommunications, Information and Computer Technology, Defence, Energy (including renewables), Transport and Consumer Electronics. The role provides the basis of learning with potential to specialise as a Hardware Engineer, Software engineer or Systems Engineer in these sectors and can extend from design of integrated circuits through to complete systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Embedded Electronic Systems Design and Development Engineers will spend their careers in these industries developing the next generations of products such as smartphones, electric vehicles, communications satellites, smart grids and bringing concepts such as smart cities into reality. For others, an initial grounding in design and development will prove an excellent launch pad for a career in applications engineering, product management, marketing or general management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Embedded Electronic Systems Design and Development Engineer must be proficient in a wide range of skills, underpinned by academic understanding, to enable them to work across these sub-sectors and specialisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices will complete a Degree that will support the fundamental scientific and mathematical principles that equip them with the understanding required to operate effectively and efficiently at a high level within any of these sectors. This will be supported by vocational training to develop the required competencies specific to particular roles within the chosen sectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A competent Embedded Electronic Systems Design and Development Engineer will meet the following requirements:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 167px;&quot; width=&quot;167&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;K&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 534px;&quot; width=&quot;534&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;at is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;167&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical circuit theory&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;534&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding of basic electrical theory&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;167&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electronic components&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td width=&quot;534&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge of the method of operation of basic semiconductors and passive components including their most common uses.
