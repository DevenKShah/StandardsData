  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building Control Surveyors provide an impartial, independent and accountable third party service certificating that building work achieves compliance with minimum standards, namely those set out in the Building Regulations. Building Control differs from other surveying roles in that Surveyors perform what is essentially an enforcement function, ensuring compliance through the Building Act 1984. In addition to construction technology, a Building Control Surveyor requires a full working knowledge of Building Regulations and associated legislation in force at the time work has been carried out in relation to areas such as structural, thermal, fire, acoustics, ventilation and inclusive design. Building Control Surveyors must be excellent communicators as this is a highly customer-facing role, requiring diplomacy and assertiveness, remaining impartial using the powers conferred on them to prosecute if necessary to protect the health and safety of people, and the wider environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The main duties and tasks of a Building Control Surveyor involve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To ensure a safe, healthy and sustainable built environment in compliance with the Building Act 1984 and its legislation, through the delivery of a customer focussed, efficient service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be able to evaluate plans, drawings, specifications and other documents submitted for building regulation approval for all types of building work to enable a decision to be given and, where appropriate, ways to make building projects more cost effective.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be able to inspect all types of building work to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations and keep appropriate records of the visits made to sites.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Issue completion/final certificates when the work has been carried out satisfactorily.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Liaise and communicate with members of the public, construction professionals and statutory bodies and undertakers, e.g. Fire &amp;amp; Rescue Service, highways, water companies, planning and environmental health departments and local authorities to ensure minimum standards and legal requirements are achieved.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep up to date with current regulations and legislation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enforce Regulatory compliance including legal action as and when necessary in relation to defective construction work on site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enforce Regulatory compliance including legal action as and when necessary in relation to demolitions and dangerous structures to ensure public safety.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate competency in the administrative process of all types of Building Regulation applications and the use of a back office management system including appropriate charges.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building Control Surveyors may also be known as: Building Control Officer; Building Control Inspector; Building Control Consultant; Building Control Assistant; Building Control Advisor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building Control Surveyors may be contracted or employed by local authorities, private employers, and Approved Inspectors in the capacity of enforcing the Building Act and Regulations. Building Control Surveyors typically work as part of a team including technical support administrators and other surveyors of varying expertise and experience usually reporting to a building control manager.
