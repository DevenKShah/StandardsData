  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IT Solutions Technicians develop, implement and maintain complete IT solutions, including their hardware infrastructure (such as servers and networks) and software (such as operating systems, middleware and applications). They work as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Many such teams will be modern “DevOps” style teams, which carry out the full set of stages across the whole solution lifecycle: requirements gathering, solution development, testing, implementation and ongoing support. In more traditional organisations the team is likely to be focused more at one or other end of this broad set of activities. Such teams may well be in transition to a modern “DevOps” style team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An IT Solutions Technician applies a professional methodology or framework to gather and analyse requirements; to design, develop, test, and implement IT solutions and to provide ongoing support both directly to end users and for the underlying IT services. The specific tasks undertaken vary depending on what needs to be achieved by the team at any particular time. Some tasks may be very technical, others may be more analytical, business or user focused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IT Solutions Technicians undertake duties across the complete IT solution, working on the team’s core activities so all apprentices take a common core and then choose one of two options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IT Hardware Solutions Technicians&lt;/strong&gt; undertake activities in the area of the infrastructure aspects of solutions such as servers and networks (fixed or mobile);&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include IT Solutions Technician, Technical Analyst, Junior Support Analyst, IT Support Analyst, Systems Analyst, IT Technical Support, IT Systems Support Technician, Junior DevOps Professional, IT Service Desk or Technical Service Support (at 2nd, 3rd or 4th line support)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&lt;strong&gt;T Software Solutions Technicians &lt;/strong&gt;undertake activities in the area of applications and supporting components such as databases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typical job titles include IT Solutions Technician, Service Analyst, Junior Systems Analyst, Systems Developer, Database Technician, IT Support Analyst, IT Support Technician, IT Systems Support, Junior DevOps Professional, IT Service Desk or Applications Support Technician (at 2nd, 3rd or 4th line support)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst any entry requirements will be a matter for individual employers, typically an apprentice might be expected to already have 5 GCSEs (A*-C); other relevant qualifications or experience; or pass an aptitude test.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CORE: &lt;/strong&gt;All IT Solution Technicians require the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot;

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Develop, implement, and maintain IT solutions. A solution is a means of solving a problem or a means of improving any existing functionality to gain demonstrable business efficiencies. For the IT Solutions Technician Standard, Solutions will be technical and involve consideration of multiple components and involve interdependencies with other systems. A solution would also seek to determine root cause issues rather than just address symptoms and viable alternatives would always be considered. An understanding of existing infrastructure and the potential impact that solutions can have, is key to this Standard. Appropriate Solutions could involve software, hardware, or a combination to address particular challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in organisations, large and small, in all sectors including public, private, and voluntary organisations. Organisations are increasingly implementing technology to support all functions of business requiring planning and investigation, methodical implementation, and ongoing maintenance to deliver solutions that are suitable, effective and provide value for money.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of an IT Solutions Technician is to develop, implement, and maintain IT solutions. They work as part of a multi-disciplinary team and are required to work across the whole solutions lifecycle including requirements gathering, solutions development, testing, implementation, and ongoing support. The specific tasks undertaken vary depending on what needs to be achieved by the team at any particular time. Some tasks may be very technical, others may be more analytical, business or user focused.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key to this role will be the need to understand the stakeholders and business needs within the organisation and be confident translating these into designs and solutions. The IT Solutions Technician will apply a structured methodology or framework to gather and analyse requirements. They will liaise with stakeholders and complete in-depth research to support their designs; presenting these to relevant parties in the business and advising how the solution will meet objectives. They will create concept and logical designs of the solutions, evidencing how the objectives can be met.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An IT Solutions Technician will be involved in the development, testing and implementation of designed solutions, including assisting in the management of solutions or projects. As such, they will have a broad understanding of technology areas and the needs of the organisation. This may involve working with other technicians to simplify complex processes and communicating with non-solution stakeholders on the reasons and justification of design choices. IT Solutions Technicians may develop prototype solutions to apply structured testing methodologies. They work within a change management processes during the implementation and are a key member of the problem team. Ongoing maintenance and support will be provided to users and the wider business, ensuring that the solution continues to function as expected and meet business needs.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
