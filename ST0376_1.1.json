  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the role&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A motorcycle technician services and repairs motorcycles, motorised scooters, all-terrain vehicles (ATV’s), tricycles and vehicles where the rider sits astride the frame, within either the franchised or independent motorcycle sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A motorcycle technician works on all of the systems of the motorcycle. The nature of the work ranges from replacing components through to rectifying complex faults with the aid of specific diagnostic methods and equipment. Motorcycles require individual set up and adjustment in relation to rider requirements which range from leisure, commuting, commercial and competition use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Today’s motorcycle technician has to demonstrate expertise in the technical side of their role. They need strong problem solving skills and a good grasp of the theoretical, practical and safety aspects of motorcycle systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must be able to work independently and also operate as an effective team member, understand how their workshop and a motorcycle business functions from a commercial perspective, develop good customer handling skills and identify ways in which they can work efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Typically, three years&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Entry requirements&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Individual employers will set their own selection criteria for the applicants. However, it is recommended that to optimise the chance of selection a candidate can demonstrate an interest in the motorcycle environment. It is also recommended that the employer assesses the candidate’s ability to demonstrate mechanical skills and communicate both orally and in writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Qualifications&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Apprentices without level 2 English and maths will need to achieve this level prior to completion of their apprenticeship.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Technicians must have knowledge and understanding of the types, application and unique characteristics of motorcycles, scooters, tricycles, ATV’s quad all-terrain vehicles (EU Type Approval L category) where the rider sits astride the frame and of motorcycle technologies:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frame construction and

standard individuals will be able to work towards higher levels of technical training, including master technician or professional accreditation, along with supervisory and managerial positions. In addition, manufacturers may offer their own specific product related advanced training that will be made available to individuals working in the franchised industry or as continued professional development (CPD). On successful completion of this apprentice standard the individual will be eligible to apply to join the Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) Professional Register, a register of qualified time serving individuals in all aspects of the motor industry, enabling the public and employers to verify the person has qualified as an apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;This standard is due for review in three years.&lt;/p&gt;",
