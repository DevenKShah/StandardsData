to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply general workplace health, safety and welfare requirements when undertaking construction steel fixing activities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan and undertake work practise productively.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply safe working techniques for moving, lifting and handling pre-assembled and manufactured elements, working at heights and using access equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read, interpret and work to drawings, specifications and construction information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assemble, position and fix manufactured elements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply safe use, storage and maintenance of hand tools, power tools and ancillary equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use a range of reinforcing steel products to shape and assemble structures to specification, both on and off the construction site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cut, bend and connect reinforcing steel.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Position and fix pre-assembled

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in The Construction and the Built Environment sector.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steel Fixers work on various developments including commercial and industrial units, multi-storey housing and civil engineering projects like roadworks, tunnels and bridges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to construct steel reinforcement which forms a vital part of any concrete structure. Steel Fixers construct reinforcement for columns, beams, walls and floors to which concrete is added to create the solid structure. They are using steel wire to tie together various diameters of steel reinforcement bar or mesh matts, that will need to be cut to length, bent to shape and fixed together. Components can be constructed in situ on a construction site or constructed elsewhere, then moved into position and tied into place on site. It is important that Steel Fixers work in a safe and accurate manner in order to complete the construction of the structure in accordance with the requirement set out in the construction drawings, to maintain the integrity of the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with other trades such as formwork carpenters, groundworkers, scaffolders as well as supervisors, site management, architects, designers, contractors and customers. The working environment is often outdoors on a construction site and can be physically demanding. Steel Fixers often work at height, such as on high rise buildings, and therefore health and safety are of paramount importance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for working in a team, under supervision, using machinery and tools to create structures or components from the designs, digital model, plans and specifications of architects and designers that meet the client’s expectations.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;",
