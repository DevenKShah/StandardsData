  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Systems Engineers focus on solving some of the most complex engineering challenges. They do this by collecting andorganising all the information needed to understand the whole problem, exploring it from all angles, and then finding the most appropriate solution. A Systems Engineer might typically work in either the problem definition or solution provider environments, mapping out the requirements for a complex system and defining architectures for different potential solutions, reflecting all influences across the system lifecycle; and then testing and accepting the designed solutions. This apprenticeship aims to create rounded professional Systems Engineers who understand and can practise Systems Engineering. Primarily focussed on the Defence sector, the apprentice will be able to undertake INCOSE1 Practitioner level Systems Engineering roles across Defence projects but also in other sectors, since many of the core skills will be transferable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge, skills and behaviours&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This apprenticeship will foster a common approach and language through core elements, and also allow for tailored specialist learning matched to Employers’ individual needs. An individual competency profile will be created to match each apprentice’s circumstances and needs, based on the INCOSE competencies2.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;Knowledge and skills&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;table style=&quot;border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 205px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr style=&quot;height: 165px;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 165px;&quot;&gt;Systems Thinking3&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 50%; height: 165px;&quot;&gt;Methods and techniques to identify problems and needs, capture and manage&lt;br /&gt;requirements, design solutions aided by architectures, support the build process and&lt;br /&gt;validate solutions.
