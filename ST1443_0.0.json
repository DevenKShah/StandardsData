They will maintain the safety, integrity and effective operation of plant and equipment in one or more of the following Industries that are part of or have activities that are part of the broader national infrastructure Engineering Sector: the electricity generating environment, which may use a range of different fuels including coal, gas, nuclear, wind and other renewable sources; telecommunications power plants; oil and gas refining; nuclear waste reprocessing; processing and production of chemicals; pharmaceuticals; human and animal food; cosmetics; petrochemicals; sewerage and the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical, Mechanical, Control and Instrumentation, and Wind Turbine Technicians will work on various types of plant and equipment commonly found throughout the Engineering Industry sectors and the Technicians can be expected to migrate through these sectors during the course of their careers. Dependent upon the sector that they are employed in there may be subtle differences in terms of the composition and application of the plant and equipment. However, the fundamental principles of operation will be the same regardless of the engineering sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To support the business and operational requirements of modern integrated engineered production plant and services, Electrical Systems and Process Control Technicians and Electromechanical Technicians will need to apply a range of conventional skills and knowledge to undertake engineering activities on a selection of electromechanical and process control plant, systems and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These Technicians will undertake installation, testing, servicing, removal, replacement, maintenance and repair of a range of equipment, sometimes complex, as part of planned preventative and reactive maintenance programmes. They may also undertake decommissioning activities when plant is being removed from service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Plant Operation Technicians will undertake the safe and efficient operation of complex integrated energy conversion and production plant and systems. These activities could include plant commissioning, isolation and testing, plant preparation, plant start-up and shut down, monitoring and controlling plant and dealing with critical operational problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They will be responsible for the quality of their own work, possibly others’ and&amp;nbsp; ensuring the work is completed safely, meets stakeholder quality, time and budget requirements, whilst maintaining the efficient running of plant and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Typically 3 GCSEs at grade C or higher including mathematics, English and science, or equivalent or relevant experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Technician must have the core requirements below and demonstrate the specialist requirements in one role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;A Technician will understand:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;first principles relating to the operation and maintenance of appropriate plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;relevant industry health and safety standards, regulations, and environmental and regulatory requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;maintenance and operational practices, processes and procedures covering a range of plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;the relevant engineering theories and principles relative to their occupation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Skills:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Technician will apply their knowledge of plant and systems to safely perform maintenance and operational activities with minimum supervision. This will require them to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;comply with industry health, safety and environmental working practices and regulations&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;locate, and rectify faults on plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;communicate with and provide information to stakeholders in line with personal role and responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;read, understand and interpret information and work in compliance with technical specifications and supporting documentation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;prepare work areas to undertake work related activities and reinstate those areas after the completion of the work related activities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;inspect and maintain appropriate plant and equipment to meet operational requirements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;assess and test the performance and condition of plant and equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;communicate, handover and confirm that the appropriate engineering process has been completed to specification&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core Behaviours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;h and Safety &lt;/strong&gt;– follows health and safety policies and procedures and be prepared to challenge unsafe behaviour using appropriate techniques to ensure the protection of people and property when working alone or with appropriate supervision&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality focused &lt;/strong&gt;– ensures that work achieves quality standard both occupationally and personally&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;rking with others &lt;/strong&gt;– works well with people from different disciplines,

  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;Engineering maintenance technicians work in a range of industries that use plant - machinery, apparatus and fixtures - and equipment. This includes energy, leisure entertainment, manufacturing, processing, and utilities companies. The working environments vary across the industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a core and options apprenticeship. An apprentice must be trained and assessed against the core and one option. The options are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;electrical and control and instrumentation technician&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;electrical and mechanical maintenance technician&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical and control and instrumentation maintenance technicians work covers electrical and control and instrumentation. For example, motors, single-phase and three-phase, power supplies, low voltage or high-voltage electrical distribution, programmable logic controllers, flow meters, heat exchangers and safety controls.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrical and mechanical maintenance technicians work covers electrical and mechanical. For example, motors, single-phase and three-phase, power supplies, and low voltage or high-voltage electrical distribution, actuators, fans, pumps, valves, gearboxes, and pipework.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Engineering maintenance technicians maintain plant and equipment to optimise operation. They conduct planned and preventative maintenance to prevent issues occurring and reactive maintenance when problems occur. For example, responding to breakdowns. They must prepare for and accept jobs, complete work safely to required standards, close the job, and complete work records. They also contribute to continuous improvement activities. They may complete work as part of a team or alone, depending on the task.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Daily, they interact with other maintenance technicians, engineers, and support operatives. They also have contact with other internal and external stakeholders. This may include operations, managers, quality, research and development, and admin staff. They may also have contact with auditors, regulators, and customers undertaking site visits. They typically report to an experienced maintenance engineer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They must maintain the safe and reliable operation of plant and equipment. Work must comply with any industry specific regulations. Safety is a key priority. They must comply with health, safety, and environmental regulations and procedures and sustainability practices. They must complete tasks in line with their company’s procedures and timescales. They also must also take account of business operation considerations such as cost and service level agreements.&lt;/p&gt;",
