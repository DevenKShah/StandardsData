  "occupationalSummary": "&lt;p&gt;This occupation is found in both the new build and refurbishment sectors of the construction industry. Projects vary in size, scale, and duration, ranging from the painting of a wall, refurbishment of a room to new build housing and large-scale commercial projects such as office blocks, hospitals and retail developments. Employers and contractors of painters and decorators vary in size from small, local family painting and decorating companies to major home builders and commercial contractors. Painters and decorators sometimes choose to specialise in certain types of projects and go on to become masters in their field. Examples include work on heritage and listed buildings, new build homes or commercial works. There is growing demand for painters and decorators to help meet the need for new homes and preserve the condition of existing housing and structures &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The broad purpose of the occupation is to operate in domestic and commercial properties and undertake the decoration and protection of buildings. Properties include houses, schools, offices, hospitals, factories and construction sites. Working internally or externally they work individually and/or as part of a team applying water-borne and/or solvent borne coatings and wallcoverings. They have good knowledge of paint coatings and wallcoverings and understand and comply with statutory, safety and environmental requirements. They are responsible for their own work achieving a high quality finish at the appropriate pace. They are good problem solvers and communicators and are able to interact effectively with colleagues, clients and associated trades &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their daily work, an employee in this occupation interacts with their immediate team and the site management team, which could include a senior or craft painter and decorator providing advice and guidance. They would also often liaise with other construction trades such as site carpenters and plasterers who could work for their own organisation or another contractor. Site managers again could work for their own company or the main contractor. In the case of smaller projects such as house extensions, liaison with the client and neighbours would be expected. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An employee in this occupation will be responsible for creating a high-quality finish which meets standards, specifications and design plans. They are expected to do this with due regard to all safety aspects involved with working on a construction site or domestic property, ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of themselves and others at all times. With sustainable construction at the forefront of all projects, it is expected they would give consideration to the environment and sustainability of materials, waste awareness and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;",
