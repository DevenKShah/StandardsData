  "standardInformation": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apprenticeship Standard for: Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The following standard reflects employers’ requirements for the skills, knowledge and behaviours expected from someone to be competent in the job role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Occupational Profile&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanic are employed in the Royal Navy and Merchant Navy.&#160; The engineering knowledge and skills used in the role can be transferred to other entry level engineering roles in other industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanics work from engineering drawings, data and documentation in order to undertake the testing, fault diagnosis and maintenance of electrical, mechanical and fluid power equipment on ships and submarines. This can include propulsion machinery, weapons, sensors, reactors and auxiliary systems (such as water, air conditioning, electronic equipment including programmable logic controllers, power generation and distribution).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They have knowledge and expertise in the use of both common and specialist test equipment and hand/ machine tools and the use of a range of measuring and diagnostic equipment processes to ensure system / equipment performance meet the required specification. The Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanic must comply with statutory regulations and organisational safety requirements and will be expected to work both individually and as part of a team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanic will typically work in either the Royal Navy as a Marine Engineer or Weapons Engineer, or the Royal Fleet Auxiliary or Merchant Navy as a Motorman.&#160; They will be responsible for completing daily rounds and checking machinery to ensure the ship remains operational. They will&lt;span&gt;&#160;&lt;/span&gt;learn to maintain and operate some of the most cutting-edge equipment on the planet and become familiar with a variety of sophisticated mechanical systems.&#160; They will form part of a team of Mechanics responsible to the Chief Engineer, for the maintenance and fault diagnosis of all the ships machinery and support systems.&#160; They will use their natural aptitude for fixing things, on a massive scale. That might mean working on anything from a propulsion system to a water purifying plant.&#160; They will be trained to be able to work with minimum supervision, taking responsibility for the quality and accuracy of the work they undertake.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Typical Job Titles&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the Royal Navy:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marine Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weapons Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motorman/ Motorhand (Royal Fleet auxiliary)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the Merchant Navy:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motorman/ Motorhand&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Marine Engineer&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Essential Occupation Requirements - Knowledge&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Maritime mechanical and electrical mechanic will require a comprehensive understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mathematical techniques, formula and calculation appropriate to their role.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Electrical, mechanical, pneumatic and fluid power engineering technology and principles.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The basic operation and maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment and systems used on board vessels.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Correct selection and use of electrical and mechanical hand tools and test equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quality, safety, health and environment regulations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Entry procedures and precautions for confined spaces.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And a basic knowledge of material, fluid and lubricants utilised in the maintenance of equipment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Essential occupation requirements - Skills&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comply with quality, safety, health and environmental regulations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read, analyse and interpret engineering data, drawings and documentation used in the operation and maintenance procedures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use hand and power tools to measure, mark out, cut, drill, shape and finish components to the required engineering tolerances.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assembly, removal, maintenance and overhaul components, equipment and systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Apply assembly and installation methods and techniques (such as mechanical fasteners, terminations, connectors, seals, gaskets, and jointing materials).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undertake testing, inspection and diagnostic activities on components, equipment and systems, making adjustments where applicable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comply with correct entry procedures and precautions for confined spaces.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee Behaviours &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Modern Engineering organisations require their employees to have a set of behaviours that will ensure success both in their role and in the overall company objectives.
