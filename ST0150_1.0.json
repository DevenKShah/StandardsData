  "standardInformation": "&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profile:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The engineer will install and service a range of domestic and/or commercial equipment from washing machines and micro-wave ovens in the kitchen, laundrette or restaurant to television and audio equipment in the living room. The influence of computers in controlling washing machines and providing television, have brought the installation and service requirements of these products together. In the near future, the ‘smart home’ will give wireless control of these products and link their requirements still closer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To meet the needs of these ‘smart’ products, it is essential that the engineer is I.T. literate and has an understanding of all aspects of connectivity, with the ability to make and troubleshoot I.P. connections to routers, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections, in both domestic and commercial situations. The engineer must also be capable in the usage of “Apps”. Technology is developing at a rapid rate and the range of products requiring the engineers skills will expand and require the engineer to maintain and update their knowledge and skills to meet these future needs. Many products will be integrated into the ‘smart home’ in the future and talk to each other through the “Internet of Things” giving the engineer a secure and profitable future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As most of the work is carried out in the customer’s home or business, the engineer has to be polite, well dressed and have appropriate customer facing skills. The work will be interesting and varied giving the opportunity to work with a wide range of people in differing environments. The engineer should have an enquiring mind and be able to follow a logical sequence of mechanical events or electrical tests. Following the Apprenticeship, the engineer will have additional training if they are working on gas appliances or working in specific commercial premises, they may also have the opportunity to take additional qualifications to further develop their skills and extend their prospects into management, training or development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generic job titles recognised across the industry: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Installer.
